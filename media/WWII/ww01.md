## E 4 Battle of Midway  
**hip boots**  
He can't let the Japanese run wild any more, so he's got **keep** the Japanese **at bay**.   
But **Nimitz**'s bosses in Washington have little sympathy for his predicament.  
The attack **enrages** Japan.  
The entire Japanese Military is now **galvanized** behind Admiral Yamamoto  
multiple forces that are all moving and **clockwork** and then they all come together.  
You'd have to say that they have the **upper hand**.  
We love making mountains out of **molehill**.  
Wow, **eureka**, we've got it.  
From the first **torpedo** **squadron**, only one man survives. -  
This is America's last shot to kind of check the Japanese and prevent them from making their position **indomitable**. -  
It's been an absolute **holocaust**.

## E 3 Pearl Harbor  
This shocked the world, this vast **czarist** empire could be beaten on the battlefield by these funny little people in this island.  
There is **poisonous** brew of **militarism**, **grudge against** the West.  
**Tojo**
For the Japanese delegates, it's an **abomination**. -  
Western **hypocrisy**  
but the Americans were not that **receptive**.  
**Roosevelt** was someone who played all hid cards **very close to the vest**.  
**off-hours**, they're going to the clubs, they're just having a really good time.  
**Air strips**  
**Yamamoto**
So the American sanction threatened to **unhinge** this Japanese war effort.  
if the war is now inevitable, Japan will **strike the first blow**.  
They looked at Americans saw it as ultimate sort of **decadent** power, consumer culture, **materialism**. -  
There is a real irony here, On the one hand, Yamamoto has been saying for months that we would be insane to go to war against the Americans. And yet, on the other hand, he is absolutely **dogmatic** about making sure that his own vision of the attack against Americans is adopted.  
He issues an order that requires his air **fields** to put all of their aircraft on the center of the **tarmac**, where they can be guarded **around the clock**. -  
**fatalism**  
**empire**, **emperor**  
**emotive** music playing  
It would have been just a **cacophony** of noise and a crush of men going in these narrow **passageways**. -  
The Americans tend to **disparage** the technology prowess of the Japanese. -  
stripped out their most **potent** weapon.  
The Japanese really kicked over a **hornet's nest**.  
Once the United States was in the war, with this **stupendous** economic and industrial power, and the allies must in the end, **prevail**. -  
Roosevelt calls it **dastardly** and evil, he calls it a day of **infamy**. -  


## E 2 Battle of Britain
**RAF** 
**Luftwaffe**   
**Supermarine** **Spitfire**  
basically he just **concocts** a **crock** of lies, it is all based on the **flimsiest** of intelligence. -    
**dowding** system  
**sextant**  
But the planned **knockout** of the RAF on Eagle Day... turns into a **drubbing** for Luftwaffe. -  
life for the average RAF pilot during August, it's sort of **schizophrenic** existence. - 
top of the **glamor** tree  
**Dogfight** **ensure** over the Thames Estuary... with over 1000 aircrafts involved.  
The **bliz** has begun.  
**bear** the **brunt**  
**head on**  


## E 1 Blitzkrieg
**Prussian** general   
Iron and **ore**  
We set up **reconnaissance** of enemy movements.  
We also secretly attack in the **Ardennes**, in this difficult area.  
It makes me so **cross** every time I think about it.  
What they don't have is any kind of tactical **nous** whatsoever  
**dutch courage**
