I had to **smuggle** myself into my own lands thanks to Greyjoys.  
Our **larder** are almost empty.  
You look **exquisite**, child.  
Must be exciting to **flit** from one camp to the next.  
Brought shame on the **Citadel** with his **repugnant** experiments.  
Go to kitchen and instruct all the **leftovers** form the feast will be brought to the **kennels**.  
What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the **latter** **sort of place**.  
A royal wedding is a history, the time has come for all of us to **contemplate** our history.  
Bring me my **goblet**.  

GOT IV 3  
----  
Tywin **extends** an **olive branch**.  
I'm sure you've had quite a **fright**. Rest easy.  
But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who **executed** your father, **tormented** you for years, and you **fled** the scene of his murder.  
In any case, this would not be an **opportune** moment to **press** the issue.  
They're all **a tray of cakes** next to death.  
A great **doughy** **lump** I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.  
A good king must **just**.  
Everyone **applauded** his reforms.  
Was that truly **just** for him, to abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too **gullible** to recognize?  
You've any experience of **treasuries** and **granaries** or **shipyards** and soldiers?  
(**granary** province)  
A wise king listen to his counselors and **heeds** their advice until he **comes of age**.  
(appetite for **further** knowledge)  
He'll **squirm** his way to freedom given the chance.  
There's fresh **hay** in the bar.  
We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the **clutches** of **depravity**.  
Slaughtering **livestock** more like.  
Walder Frey committed **sacrilege** that day.  
Raiders come **plundering**, steal our food, steal our silver.  
The whole country has gone **sour**  
You got any **ale**?  
She can't lift a **bale** of **hay**.  
I don't have much, but I have hidden a bit of silver from the **bandits**.  
They don't have enough men between them to raid a **pantry**.  
I've never hard of visions and **prophecies** winning a war.  
Are you **interrogating** me, Lord Tywin?  
If I cut your throat today, I'll be **drawn and quartered** tomorrow.  
So you deny the murder? --- **Categorically**  
(the producers **categorically** deny that they're **dumbing down** the show)  
(**Dumbing down** is the deliberate oversimplification of intellectual content within education, literature, cinema, news, video games and culture in order to relate to those unable to assimilate more sophisticated information)  
And as custom dictates, three judges will **render** a **verdict**. I will **preside**.  
(**presides** over the Senate)  
If I were arranging a royal **assassination**, I'd plan it in a such way I wouldn't be standing **gawking** like a fool when the king died.  
Horses are **dumber** than men.  


## E4  
I remember when they **rowed** us away from shore  
How many children did the Great Masters **nail** to **mileposts**?  
He hated the little **twat**, sure.  
My trial for **regicide**, yes, I know.  
If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes and gave **irrefutable** evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei.  
She's offering a **knighthood** to whomever finds Sansa Stark.  
Marrying a Targaryen was **all the rage** back then.  
(They are also all the rage)  
But the moment I saw my **intended**, with his **twitchy** little **ferret**'s face and **ludicrous** silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do it.  
How **absentminded** of me.  
I was the best **archer** in my **hamlet**.  
Let the **mutineers** take care of Snow.  
(It is death for all **mutineers** in England)  
If I told you to find that **murderous** little bitch, and bring me her head. Would you do it?  
You're keeping him from harm. It's **chivalry**.  
A crippled boy being pulled on a **sledge** by a **simpleton**.  
Every shelter or village will be **deserted**.  
Your **foray** to Craster's Keep, I'll **sanction** it.  


## E5  
John snow **embark** a new mission  
It would be some **consolation**, wouldn't it?  
(find **consolation** in one's work)  
It's a pleasure to make your **acquaintance**, Laddy Arryn.

In their cluthes and **tried** for murder.  
Fish. The **sigil** of House Tully

He hasn't told you about the **vile** things they do with their bodies?  
They will if you **nance** around like that.  
Who told you that **shite**?  
You're a poet for your **paramour**?  
(a woman who **cohabits** with an important man)

The **lookout** screams "Two pirate ships!"  
The crew is **shivering** like scared mice.  
There's a **chest** of the good stuff left back at your house.

Keep your mouth shut, no more **outburst**.  
I'm guilty of a far more **monstrous** crime.  


## E 7  
Tyrion **enlists** an unlikely ally. Daario **entreats** Dany to allow him to do what he does best. Jon's warnings about the Wall's vulnerability fall on **deaf ears**. Brienne follows a new lead on the road with Pod.  

I'd enjoy watching Bronn **disembowel** that **pompous** child beater.  
Her **captor**.  
How would we **range** north.  
You'll cut off our legs, **pluck** out our eyes, leave us **cowering** behind the Wall, hoping the storm to pass.

She is **dim-witted**.  
If anyone wants to **sell you out**, you'd **double** the price.

**pampered** little shit you are  
Could you bring me the **vial** over there?  
**make it count**  
You don't need powders and **potions**, you don't need lie.  
I fear the masters will simply **bide** their time, wait for the invaders to leave and **reassert** control.  
Don't get me started with **gravy**  
You can't give up upon **gravy**, no gravy, no pie.  
Like eggs dropped on the floor, sometimes pieces remain **intact**.  
Don't be **coy** with me, you little whore.

She **turned on** me  
You could see it in the way she raised that boy, feeding him from her won **teats** when he is 10 years old.  
By staying out of the **fray**, you've allowed Tywin Lannister.  
Don't ever **presume** to touch me again, or speak my name.  
You have until **dusk** to collect your things and leave the city.  
**Moors**, **fields**, hills  
Now I'm the **warden** of North, the North is mine.  
It's a **fleabite**.  
That what it means to the lord of **Vale**  
What's the punishment for **regicide**?  
**fratricide** is brothers.  
**Filicide** is sons.  
I wasn't **deterred**, I was the smartest person I knew.  
The Mountain and the **Viper**  

## E9  
Her **fangs** were sharp, but she knew how to use them.  
Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger **minge**.  
You're alright, of course your are, my brave little **fella**.  
> Do you know what leadership means, John snow, it means that the person in charge get **second-guessed** by every clever little **twat** with a mouth.  

They got a big fat one and a little **bony** one **manning** the front.

Tyrion, put down the **crossbow**.  
Your brother I guess, he always had a **soft spot** for you.
