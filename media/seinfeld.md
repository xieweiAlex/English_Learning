I'm **swamped**.  
what am I supposed to do with all this **paella**? -  
**you don't say**.  
But he's afraid to fly alone. You know, he is kind of **withdrawn**.  
No, it was **spur of the moment**.  
**corned beef**.  
He's **ripping you off**.  
This will hardly put a dent in my **fumigation** bill.  
It's an **orgiastic** feast for the senses, a **wanton** festival of sights, sounds and colors. -  
Because his **moth**, you don't buy my raincoat?  

To my **adoring** husband.   
Who wouldn't like me in this **leotard**? I look amazing in this **leotard**. -  
Bottle wipe **supersedes** it.  

Can't you switch for another **midget**?  
So now, you're gonna keep going out with her for **spite**? -  

Cause I will never forget that **flinty** voice. It is **tattooed in my brain**. -  
He is a male **bimbo**.   
**Horning in** my rock climbing trip today.  
He asked me. - You put him **on the spot**.  

Doctor? He is a **podiatrist**.  
I was merely speaking **extemporaneously**.  

I like your place, it's very **unassuming**.  
George doesn't work, he is **bum**. That's why he lives with us.  

Yeah, **dandruff**, **kasha**, **mothball**, **cheap carpeting**. It's **potpourri**, really.   
You wanna **lug** it uptown, it's yours.  
I mean, somebody asks me where is Israel, I don't **fly off the handle**.  
You're **grounded**.  

I've never met your sister, but obviously these are no **hard-and-fast** rules.  
Something tells me she's a **knockout**.  
Every muscle she touches just ... **oozes**...  
Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down, trying to **clear the air**.  

I want you to have this job, but of course... **sodomy** is a prerequisite.  
**Rest stop** supply.  
Gino, you've **outdone** yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had.   
If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm **ensconced**.   
I'd like to have **shoehorn** hands.  
Look at him, he is **grotesque**. - You think?  - Do I think? He is **repugnant**.  
It was a **cinch**.  

Isn't there a better way to spend your **twilight** years?  
I might be old, but I'm **spry**.  
They say they never saw anybody **go after** balls with such **gusto**.

The woman is absolutely **mesmerizing**.  
You're really **smitten**.  

I'm **on a roll**! I'm just **willing** these great parking spots.  
The most important thing is you help with the **bris**.  
Why are all those people **milling** around my car?  
**mohel**
You know, you should **call that off**, Elaine. It's a **barbaric** ritual!  
It's been a very **trying** couple of days around the hospital.  
Oh look, a man is flying, a man is flying! And then ... **splat**.  
The damage unfortunately, has **marred** an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually **undrivable**.  
You greedily, **callously** want to profit from it?  
Listen to me, you **quack**.  
Embedded in the carpet fibers, deep, deep in the **shag**, broken glass. Bits of broken glass you can never get up.   
One more peep, I'll **slice** you like a smoked **sturgeon**!  


**Bologna** sandwiches.  
I can not have this constant **bickering**.  
Stress is very damaging to the **epidermis**.   
My hands have got to be in **tip-top** shape.  
**Keep the television down** and the conversation to a minimum.  

The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't what's going on with the **papayas**! 
What the hell is **plantain**?  
God isn't **out to get you**, George.  
She is extremely **dainty**.  
It's nice to see such fine, **upstanding** women, in **gainful** employment, Mr. Visaki.  

Jerry, this peach is **subpar**.  

I'm gonna have to take a **biopsy** on this.  
I was really **percolating**.  
How about we **let bygones be bygones**.  

This guy's got quite a **racket**. I take you to dinner, and then drop you off at his apartment.  

This is **found money**. I want to **parlay** it. I want to make a big score.  
He is Okay. In fact, he and Elaine are getting pretty **chummy**.  
We could be **tried for murder**.  
**Prognosis**... Negative. He is not doing well, the doctor doesn't know what it is. They're **baffled**.  


He is **gypping** us.  

**afraid not**.  
**afraid so** 
Now I have to be real, that's when it all **falls apart**.  

I think I'm **better off going** one on one.  
It's too **trendy**, no Isabellas.  

I **talked him into** it.  
after **consummation**.  

I was trying to climb the robe, Jerry was **spotting** me.  
**I beg to differ**.  


That's a **relex**. **Cleavage, poke**, **cleavage, poke**.  
If **it had anything at all to do with** what you perceived as me **leering** at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that.  
I did not **leer**.  


But **between you and me**, you would've **paid through the nose**.  
He was dark, **disturbed**.  
**Hasta la vista**.  
he **snubbed** at me.  


I will buy you popcorn and soda and we'll **call it even**.  
George, you're **sapping** my strength.  
Jerry, we're **riffing**. No, I'm not riffing, I'm ignoring.  
I'm **getting the hang** of it.  

It's a **crapshoot**.  

**bad-mouth**  
Now I'm gonna **put the kibosh on you**.  
Where is the **rush**?  
I'm just gonna **pop-in**. - Good, men love that.  
My home is a... **shrine** to you.

KRAMER: (**debonair** smile) Well, itâ€™d be our little secret.  

A car just bashed into a parked car, and **sped off**, right on my **block**!  
What are you, **yellow**?  
They both smile **flirtatiously** at each other.  
Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for **mutilating** the property of a stranger, then she **sped off** like a criminal!  
What kind of a sick **lowlife** would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're **mentally disturbed**.  
(Michael throws down his **serviette**), Michael: You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?  
The **intercom** buzzes, Jerry walks over and presses the button  
Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' **in abeyance**, until she completes the series.  
**Don't sell yourself short** saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.  
Robin: Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'. George: Well, **that's a given**.

Now you listen to me, suck face! You tell anybody, anything, and I will **carve** my **initials** in your brain tissue!
I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all **juiced up** with your story about having the affair with the **matador**!
Becky: **You have got some nerve**! You smash up my car, you don't admit it, and now you want to ask me out on a date?  
Kramer is walking toward her door, hair **slicked** back, with a **bouquet** of flowers in his hand.  

I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to **get away with** something. That's my **overview**.
You're still here. You're a **dynamo**.  
George: So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips **swivelling**, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
Jerry: **Convulsing**?
George: **Convulsing**?
So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the **ammonia**, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.  
Jerry takes out a **hankerchief** and starts fake-crying in it.  

Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a **heckler** ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back **on the wagon**.  

Maybe the **dingo** ate your baby.  
the last time a woman said that to me I **wound up** apologizing to her.  
Every time I pass her desk, I have to plan a little **patter**.

But if I get the **sniffles**, you better be there.  
The woman has my papers you told her she's **pretentious**?  

This guys is probably **on a bender**.  
Jerry **gargles**? He does it like 6 times a day.  
**Mutt**? I'll **wager** his parents are more pure than yours.

What are you gonna do? **Badger** a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?  
You though you could **waltz through** the rest of life and never **bump into** me again, but you were wrong, Jerry!  
What do you think, I'm a poor **pathetic** **wretch**?  

Comm on, That's $182 there, I don't think that's **anything to sneeze at**.  

I gonna **slip him a mickey**

**Tan pants**  
My brother in law once left a message on this guy's machine, and he **blurted** out some business information he wasn't suppose to, and it would've cost him $15,000.  
I just **bumped into** him around the corner, what a coincidence.  

I don't want to be **presumptuous**.  
It's not bad, it's **coming along**.
