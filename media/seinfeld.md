## Season 3 

I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to **get away with** something. That's my **overview**.
You're still here. You're a **dynamo**. -  
George: So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips **swivelling**, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
Jerry: **Convulsing**?
George: **Convulsing**?
So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the **ammonia**, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.  
Jerry takes out a **hankerchief** and starts fake-crying in it.  

Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a **heckler** ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back **on the wagon**.  

Maybe the **dingo** ate your baby.  
the last time a woman said that to me I **wound up** apologizing to her.  
Every time I pass her desk, I have to plan a little **patter**.  
it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition. I'll be **ostracized** from the community.  
But if I get the **sniffles**, you better be there.  
The woman has my papers you told her she's **pretentious**?  

This guys is probably **on a bender**.  
Jerry **gargles**? He does it like 6 times a day.  
**Mutt**? I'll **wager** his parents are more pure than yours.  

George got him fired, he **squealed on** him.  
**tattletale** - I didn't **tattle**.  
**flaunting** convention.

The chain reaction of calls, this is gonna **set off**.  
**cannibalism**  

**pesto**  
**busboy**  

When I finally see her, I'm like a little **groveling** worm.  
What are you gonna do? **Badger** a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?  
You though you could **waltz through** the rest of life and never **bump into** me again, but you were wrong, Jerry!  
What do you think, I'm a poor **pathetic** **wretch**?  

Comm on, That's $182 there, I don't think that's **anything to sneeze at**.  

I gonna **slip him a mickey**  
he might **keel over**  
That one looks like a **blowfish**.  
I'd also like to welcome back our little, **shrimpy** friend.  
He is a **holistic**.  


## Season 1 


Every time I come to the building, I'm gonna have to sneak around like a **cat burglar**.  
**divine plan** (will of God)  
You **numskulls**  
how did you get the **goop** out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new **nozzle**.  
Maybe you think we're **in cahoots**.   

Frankly, I prefer the company of **nitwits**.  
I say this with **unblemished record** of staunch **heterosexuality**.  
The waiter was **trembling**.  
That's good, he'd **clunk** our heads together like Moe.  
They never **fumble** for the checkbook.  
**I rest my case**.  

That's just the way I was **brought up**.  
**Tan pants**  
My brother in law once left a message on this guy's machine, and he **blurted** out some business information he wasn't suppose to, and it would've cost him $15,000.  
I just **bumped into** him around the corner, what a coincidence.  

I don't want to be **presumptuous**.  
It's not bad, it's **coming along**.
