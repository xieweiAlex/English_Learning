Clares makes a **cold-blooded** move at work.  
It's **degrading**, I know 
when the **tit**'s that big, everybody **gets in line**  
You're well aware that I do not **drop the ball** on things like this   
check out the **masterhead**  
I think you're **dismantling** what we've built over the ten years.  
I'm **up to here** with them, Donald, for lying, for turning their back on you.  
I'm not a **wheeler dealer**  
You're **formidable**, Frank, people respect you.  
Let me be **sidelines** for this.  
How very **deep throat** of you.  
**editorial**  
**out of shape** 
both **passive-aggressive** and **condescending**  
It's golden, it's in **bull's eye**  
have it **steam cleaned** **over the weekend**.

I'm **awfully** sorry  
It's a **chicken-shit** move  
**hubris**, ambition --- I'm **livid**  
want **retribution**?  
if you want em to take you seriously, maybe wear more than a **G-string**?  
Clare will be **over the moon**  
The **smugness**, the **false deference**  
too **queer**  
You're a fan of the **symphony**  
It's a **cheap ploy**  
Well, you certainly have my **undivided** attention.  
Is **foreplay** over?  
Washington **herald**  
I made that **neat**, did you want ...  
I'm the **whip**, it's my job to know.  
On the other hand, girls learn to be **deferential**, and anger is incompatible with **deference**.
