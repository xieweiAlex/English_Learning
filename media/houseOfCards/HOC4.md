The whole thing is **theatric**.  
It's humid as hell, though. I just got here and I'm already **soaked**.  
It's **muggier** than a street **hooker**'s **twat**. -  
We all agreed to what our version of the story is, so somebody isn't **toeing the line**.  
Doug, if our campaign manager **bites the dust**, that hurts us.  
Claire was **mortified** by those votes.  
Most of those were from Texas, which was a **lark**.  
**what's in it for me**?  
I was looking forward to watching you **go down in flames**, maybe even **behind bars**.  
Like we **grappled** with the future of America.  


## E 8  
A **chasm** opened up between them, a hallway less than 10 yards wide.  
He is **perceptive**. - **uncanny**  
We had no idea about this sort of **groundswell**. -  
Paper is strict when it comes to **moonlighting**.  
Edward Meechum was **slain** with the bullets from that very same gun.  
the Universal Background check bill has been **deafening** in these last few days.  
We would like to add one more voice to that **chorus**. -  
I think we can **pivot**.  

## E 7  
You **hurl** accusations, I'll let the press **hurl** facts.  
Our little **rascal** Lily. -  

## E 4  
My concern is him **railroading** me on the call.  
Don't **equivocate**, be confident, you have the leverage.  
> courtesy never got me anywhere.  

If Donald wants my counsel, that's his **prerogative**.  
> I imagine I'm the last person you expected to see today.  

I'm sure there's some **wariness** about us being here, but I think we have a good plan on how to handle Russia.  
Of course, he'd have a **conniption** **fit** if he knew I were in the Oval Office.  
Really, Viktor? Are we gonna **dredge** that **up**?  
I'm not here for **sightseeing trip**, Mr. President.  
Francis needs a **liver**, and I need a **bailout**.  
You flew in, you **puff up** your chest, and you pretend to play president.  

## E 3  
He **loathes** Francis, but use your best judgement.  
It's **as though** she never left.  
I can direct you to the **bullpen**, but this area is **off-limits** to the press.  
Come on, be smarter than that. Oren, she'll sue you for **slander**.  
I hope you don't **welsh** on your promise to me way you did with Oren.  
American Works is **falling flat**, you campaign manager is ten years behind ten years ago.  
If a **sliver** of Goodwind's story **holds up**..  
It's serious ma'am, I can **fill you in** on the way.
