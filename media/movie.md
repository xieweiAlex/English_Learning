### American's great divide 
I mean, just the way he spoke was so compelling and so dynamic and so **magnetizing**.  
Most people aren’t **hyperpartisan**.  
You know, that version of Sarah Palin was **electrifying**.  
She wasn’t too **highbrow**.  
And that was a direct appeal to that voting **bloc** that did **wind up** putting him in office.  
I was **anchoring** in the beginning of the day and the **midday** for most of that.  
Fox News has **cornered the market** on half of the country's television viewers.  
He got a regular **gig** with Fox and Friends.  
So even back then, he was **media-savvy**.  
No. He used to **sabre-rattle** a little about it. -  
because Obama, I think, by most people’s measure, is a good man with policies that led to **mediocre success**. And that have largely been **reversed**.  
And then Obamacare got **shoved down our throats**, without majority support in the country, which was a huge thing.  
And Obama was too **cavalier** about it….  
to **shove it down the throat** of the American people, something that affects one-sixth of the U.S. economy.   
So I’m **loath** to use the word “lie,” but that was one, and he did it for political purposes.  
you know, **puffery** about himself or how well he’s doing or someone he loves is doing. -  
Obama lied to them about something that **struck** at the very heart of their lives, their health care, their relationship with their doctor.  
But he was being **dismissive** of half the country, whose concerns McCain was trying to raise, right? -  
There was a **slow boil** going with that group of would-be voters. -  
But that day, it was just the—it was just a **spectator sport**, you know, of “Look at him.  
I mean, for me, I was looking at it more from a **journalistic** **standpoint**.
I mean, Trump has been a huge **boon** to cable news, huge boon. All news. -  
Trump was very good at **cultivating** relationships.
and I understood I needed to keep him **at arm’s length**, like you do all the candidates.
You can be **cordial**; you can be nice; you can be friendly. -  
But it is, at its heart, an **adversarial** relationship, you know, that of a politician and a reporter.
It’s **mercenary**.
He’s—he’s the Republican **front-runner**.”
And they launched a sort of **three-pronged** war.
I wasn’t **privy** to that. -  
I think Ailes would get a little bit more **deferential** to him. -  
Just give us the **blow-by-blow**, if you don’t mind.
And everybody had a **binder** like this.
And Trump had a **binder** like this, right?
But if you looked through his binder, and I read every page, there was one theme that started to **come through**.
And my job as the **anchor** was not to go out there and be **Helen of Troy**.
And if you manage to get past, can you win the general if you’re too **hard-line**?
Fine. We **forged forward**.
I don’t judge the viewers. They’re allowed to laugh and have a moment of **levity** if they want. -  
> what we almost heard him do on that call with the Ukrainian leader, which was: “I’ve been very nice to you, right?  I’ve been very nice to you. Maybe I won’t be.”
And that’s Trump **in a nutshell**.
Breitbart decided to **go after** you. What’s the point?  

### Amazon documentary  
That's a **tall order**  
I hope your words are **prophetic** once again.  
Is that an **apt** description of Jeff? -  
it didn't take long for Bezos' vision to prove **prescient** -  
He was a small, **nondescript**, **sandy-haired** man setting on the desk  
**eruptive** laugh  
**napoleonic** ambition  
one percent of inspiration, 99 percent of **perspiration**  
from the **get-go**  
A little bit exciting, a little bit **nutty**  
Customer obsession was our **North Star**  
you know what they're **falling for**  
that felt a little more **unsavory**, but that was the business of Amazon.  
**fourfold**  
We're going to **forego** profits, in order to take market share.  
it was very **irksome**, early, big issue for the book vendors  
he owns the **main street**, not the building on the corner, the entire main street  
   
### The Shawshank redemption 
I doubt they'll **kick up** any **fuss**.  
I'm gonna go **pinch of a loaf**. When I come back this is all gone, all right?  
This pool of slave labor you got, you can **underbid** any contractor in town.  
If I don't get it, I **go under**, that's a fact  
I **conjured** him **out of thin air**  
They're gonna **wind up** chasing a **figment** of my imagination -  
On a **two-year stretch** for **B&E** -  
Big, **twitchy**, fucker  
Kind of **roomie** you pray you don't get.  
some **hotshot** banker  
He hears your **tale of woe** and quite naturally wants to **cheer you up**. -  
How can you be so **obtuse**?  
I'd be just as **indictable** as you for laundering that money  
But I **wound up** here, bad luck I guess  
This is just shitty **pipe dreams**  
Every man has his **breaking point**.  
**much obliged**  


### V for Vendetta  
The world's biggest **leper colony**.  
The only **verdict** is **vengeance**, a **vendetta**, held as a **votive** not **in vain**, for the value and **veracity** of such shall one day **vindicate** the **vigilant** and the **virtuous**.  
**Verily**, the **vichyssoise** of **verbiage** **veers** most **verbose**.  
first, the **overture**  
Here comes **crescendo**!  
A cow getting **crucified**. It's **hysterical**  
The security of the **familiar**, the **tranquility** of repetition.  
I enjoy them as much as any **bloke**.  
for those who will listen, the **enunciation** of truth.  
I **maced** that **detective**. Why did I do that?  
**interrogation** cell  
They were **interned** at Belmarsh  
for obvious reasons, we have to keep this **discreet**  
As only **celluloid** can deliver  
**reclamation**  
I'm in need of someone with some **theatrical** skill  
the security of these information is **paramount**  
You started as a **botanist**, didn't you?  
**Bonjour**, **mademoiselle**  
**chemical shed**  
   
If we're to be prepared for any **eventuality**, then it can't be ignored any longer  
**airborne** attack  
a young, **up-and-coming** politician  
he is completed **single-minded** and has no regard for the political process.  
a memorial is built to **canonize** their victims  
tonight, we must retain **steadfast**, we must remain determined  
**bollocks**, what are you gonna do, huh?  
   
### The Matrix  
   
the **informant** is real  
All the time, it's called **mescaline**. It's the only way to fly.  
You can't scare me with this **gestapo** crap  
**at last**  
this is a **sparring program**  
Someone can be **bent**, others and be broken.  
**Sentient** programs  
**sentinel** program  
   
All I see is **Blonde**, **Brunette**, **redhead**.  
I can arrange a much more personalized **milieu**.  
you're **right on time**  
**know thyself**  
I'm tried of that **jagoff** and all of his bullshit  
Billions of people just living out their lives... **oblivious**  
**ranking officer**  
why isn't the **serum** working?  
It's **repulsive**, I must get out of here, I must get free.
