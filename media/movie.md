### American's great divide  
I mean, just the way he spoke was so compelling and so dynamic and so **magnetizing**.  
Most people aren’t **hyperpartisan**.  
You know, that version of Sarah Palin was **electrifying**.  
She wasn’t too **highbrow**.  
And that was a direct appeal to that voting **bloc** that did **wind up** putting him in office.  
I was **anchoring** in the beginning of the day and the **midday** for most of that.  
Fox News has **cornered the market** on half of the country's television viewers.  
He got a regular **gig** with Fox and Friends.  
So even back then, he was **media-savvy**.  
No. He used to **sabre-rattle** a little about it.  
because Obama, I think, by most people’s measure, is a good man with policies that led to **mediocre success**. And that have largely been **reversed**.  
And then Obamacare got **shoved down our throats**, without majority support in the country, which was a huge thing.  
And Obama was too **cavalier** about it….  
to **shove it down the throat** of the American people, something that affects one-sixth of the U.S. economy.  
So I’m **loath** to use the word “lie,” but that was one, and he did it for political purposes.  
you know, **puffery** about himself or how well he’s doing or someone he loves is doing.  
Obama lied to them about something that **struck** at the very heart of their lives, their health care, their relationship with their doctor.  
But he was being **dismissive** of half the country, whose concerns McCain was trying to raise, right?  
There was a **slow boil** going with that group of would-be voters.  
But that day, it was just the—it was just a **spectator sport**, you know, of “Look at him.  
I mean, for me, I was looking at it more from a **journalistic** **standpoint**.  
I mean, Trump has been a huge **boon** to cable news, huge boon. All news.  
Trump was very good at **cultivating** relationships.  
and I understood I needed to keep him **at arm’s length**, like you do all the candidates.  
You can be **cordial**; you can be nice; you can be friendly.  
But it is, at its heart, an **adversarial** relationship, you know, that of a politician and a reporter.  
It’s **mercenary**.  
He’s—he’s the Republican **front-runner**.”  
And they launched a sort of **three-pronged** war.  
I wasn’t **privy** to that.  
I think Ailes would get a little bit more **deferential** to him.  
Just give us the **blow-by-blow**, if you don’t mind.  
And everybody had a **binder** like this.  
And Trump had a **binder** like this, right?  
But if you looked through his binder, and I read every page, there was one theme that started to **come through**.  
And my job as the **anchor** was not to go out there and be **Helen of Troy**.  
And if you manage to get past, can you win the general if you’re too **hard-line**?  
Fine. We **forged forward**.  
I don’t judge the viewers. They’re allowed to laugh and have a moment of **levity** if they want.  
> what we almost heard him do on that call with the Ukrainian leader, which was: “I've been very nice to you, right?  I've been very nice to you. Maybe I won’t be.”  

And that’s Trump **in a nutshell**.  
Breitbart decided to **go after** you. What’s the point?  

And so he accurately deduced that this would drive his numbers up with some **segment** of his base.
I think he’s a **savvy** politician who knows what to say and what to do to get elected.
And you know, that’s why I don’t like it when people **make light of** the nine months.
And I love Maureen, but I **resented** the column, because my life was **blown up** for nine months.
It was scary **at times**. And Breitbart kept **lighting the fire** **over and over**.
And we were doing everything in our power to **convey** to them that they needed to stop.
So **get off** of it.
They **couldn’t have cared less**.
During the whole experience, my numbers never **went down**.
I’m not **for** either side. I’m **for** truth.
It was **jarring**. It was very jarring.
and it was **on the heels of** a lot of **misogyny** that had **unfolded** in the country over the past year, not just about me  
He **sort of** **begrudgingly** loved Trump.
Because it reminded all of us that the woman who would go into office, if he lost, was no **saint** either  
not Hillary herself necessarily, but her husband, and with her **enabling**.
and **so on and so forth**, all the headlines in the New York Post and the Daily News and so on,
They didn’t **live through** it.
There was a huge body of the American people that felt ignored, **overlooked**
and **uncared** for at all by anyone in Washington for decades.
You know, the white working class in Appalachia, in these states Hillary completely **blew off** or assumed she’d win,
felt heard and like they finally had somebody in there who would **look out** for them.
about potentially doing a town hall with Obama for that group that was meant to **outreach** to that group,
They didn’t necessarily feel that way when they saw their jobs **slipping away** in manufacturing and these factories and so on,
Obama ate **arugula**; Trump **champions** **Big Macs**, you know.
What did he just say that **rhymes** with '**wussy**'?”
And I think there’s a **swath** of the American population that, look, it’s not like they love **vulgarity**  
And Hannity was my best **gauge**, right?
You know, I believed the **pollsters**.
I think we’re all coming to the **realization** that Donald Trump might be the next president of the United States.
I know that others felt devastated or **elated**.  
Like, **whoa**, everyone got this wrong.
I mean, 1% of the pollsters and the **prognosticators** called this, and everyone else was wrong, and this is a huge story.
I just don’t buy into this **catastrophic**, like, “the nation will never be the same,” you know?
We can survive any—any president, any **tumult**.  
I just—I’m a little tired of the **vapors** everyone tries to give us over everything Trump does.
The media, it’s **sickening** what they've done.
You know, the **populace** will decide.
But anybody who tells you that, you know, it’s an **existential** moment for America is full of it.  
I mean, look, impeachment, legally, it’s sort of an **amorphous** standard.  
That’s really how they left it, the Founders, because they wanted there to be some **wiggle room**.
But “and misdemeanors” opens it up, because they’re not talking about misdemeanors like he **jaywalked**, right?
That opens it up to, it could be **improper conduct**; it could be abuse of power.
And much like pornography, that’s in the eye of the **beholder**, as the Supreme Court said, “I know it when I see it.”
That means it boils down to politics, and people are going to see it through their own **partisan lenses**.
I mean, Republicans, they’re kind of going to their **trenches**, like, “No, it’s not impeachable.
and the Democrats are saying, “Oh, I’ve never seen such **unethical** conduct. This is it!
As I see it, whether it’s at the level of, you know, impeachment or not, the Democrats are like **the boy who cried wolf** on this.
and we have to enact—we have to follow the **emoluments clause** because of this  
and we need the 25—we need the 25th Amendment because he’s a **lunatic**.
And I don’t see enough Republicans in that body **turning on** a man who’s about to face reelection anyway  


### Amazon Empire - The Rise and Reign of Jeff Bezos    
That's a **tall order**  
I hope your words are **prophetic** once again.  
Is that an **apt** description of Jeff?  
it didn't take long for Bezos' vision to prove **prescient**  
He was a small, **nondescript**, **sandy-haired** man setting on the desk  
**eruptive** laugh  
**napoleonic** ambition  
one percent of inspiration, 99 percent of **perspiration**  
from the **get-go**  
A little bit exciting, a little bit **nutty**  
Customer obsession was our **North Star**  
you know what they're **falling for**  
that felt a little more **unsavory**, but that was the business of Amazon.  
**fourfold**  
We're going to **forego** profits, in order to take market share.  
it was very **irksome**, early, big issue for the book vendors  
he owns the **main street**, not the building on the corner, the entire main street  
he said they wanted a **kickback**   
they will take **retribution** against me  
Jennifer Cast ran Amazon books **division** in its **formative** years.  
Across the country, Amazon warehouses began to **spring up**, filled with millions of products.  
people just kind of **crisscrossing** this big warehouse **all day long**  
you got a **write-up**  
'Cause it's something that we've actually heard, and I don't sense it's **hyperbole**.  
It's a **testament** to just how good Amazon is.  
Amazon has the **upper hand** and the ability to basically take your business away  
as he's **cemented** himself in the city, he's started to **acquire** this physical **presence**.  
I would first disagree with the **premise**, it's not a listening device.  
Jeff Bezos's reputation has grown to **mythic**.  
I think it's a **mixed bag**, there is evidence that they have inspired innovation in certain sectors ...  
it's kind of a **grotesque** display of corporate power, to dangle 50,000 jobs and potential billions of dollars of revenue.  
But not everyone was **enthused** about giving billions in tax breaks to a trillion-dollar corporation.  
That's an **idiotic** statement on its face.  
There was noise, there was **posturing** by people in the political world, but the deal was done, so all we're talking about here is the **background noise**.  

> In what world are there no critics? Well, yeah, in an autocratic totalitarian world, maybe they're not allowed, and that's the world that Jeff Bezos somewhere in his mind thinks he is **entitled** to.  

position the other individuals as the **bully**, and **kicked the bully in the nuts**, and somehow turned this into **net positive**.  
You're basically a **pinata** dangling in front of any politician with a **populist** message.  
President Trump just sent a **chill down the spine** of Jeff Bezos. -- The present again **teed off** against Amazon on Twitter.  


### The Shawshank redemption  
I doubt they'll **kick up** any **fuss**.  
I'm gonna go **pinch of a loaf**. When I come back this is all gone, all right?  
This pool of slave labor you got, you can **underbid** any contractor in town.  
If I don't get it, I **go under**, that's a fact  
I **conjured** him **out of thin air**  
They're gonna **wind up** chasing a **figment** of my imagination  
On a **two-year stretch** for **BOn a **two-year stretch** for **B&E** -  E**  
Big, **twitchy**, fucker  
Kind of **roomie** you pray you don't get.  
some **hotshot** banker  
He hears your **tale of woe** and quite naturally wants to **cheer you up**.  
How can you be so **obtuse**?  
I'd be just as **indictable** as you for laundering that money  
But I **wound up** here, bad luck I guess  
This is just shitty **pipe dreams**  
Every man has his **breaking point**.  
**much obliged**

I **maced** that **detective**. Why did I do that?  
**interrogation** cell  
They were **interned** at Belmarsh  
for obvious reasons, we have to keep this **discreet**  
As only **celluloid** can deliver  
**reclamation**  
I'm in need of someone with some **theatrical** skill  
the security of these information is **paramount**  
You started as a **botanist**, didn't you?  
**Bonjour**, **mademoiselle**

If we're to be prepared for any **eventuality**, then it can't be ignored any longer  
**airborne** attack

### The Matrix  
   
the **informant** is real  
All the time, it's called **mescaline**. It's the only way to fly.  
You can't scare me with this **gestapo** crap

this is a **sparring program**  
Someone can be **bent**, others and be broken.  
**Sentient** programs

All I see is **Blonde**, **Brunette**, **redhead**.  
I can arrange a much more personalized **milieu**.  
you're **right on time**

I'm tried of that **jagoff** and all of his bullshit  
Billions of people just living out their lives... **oblivious**

It's **repulsive**, I must get out of here, I must get free.
