Hey Bill, **don't mind us**.  
When they found me, I was trying to **lactate** myself. -  

## E 1 

Looks like your boy **dinged** my **dangler**. -  
He is really **down in the dumps**. He is usually so **full of life**.  
Now take these off my check, you bunch of **chiselers**! -  

## E 6 

You hear that, you **jackals**?  
Here, **take a swig**. Come on, drink it!  
You **soiled** my **surplice**, you fucking **catamite**!  
I have a dozen **scabs** read to go!  
**pyro**   
I know it's a little **schmaltzy**, but we're a family and now we need to pull together.  


## E 4

Wait, you're gonna **narc** on yourself? Have I taught you nothing?  
She is a **pack rat**, good for business.  
We will **walk out** on Christmas Day.  
I'm getting a **hernia** supporting you, but this part-time job is getting out of control.   
We've had **ups and downs**, sometimes we haven't gotten along...  
And then he **laid down** on top of her, and they wrassled. I think he won.  

## E 3 

Murphy, you tell these **ingrates** that if they don't stop this illegal slow-down...  


## E 2 

Stop **pouting**, you and I would have lots of fun today.  
If they had a class called "future", I'd be **all over it**.  
Not now, I'm being **anointed**.  

And if you see a 6 year old running away from you, He is about to **compromise** your position.  

## E 1 

Mm, this **varnish**. It's so **decadent**.
