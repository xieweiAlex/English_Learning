All we want is to have a nice Christmas as a family, but you chose to **mope around** all day. 
My wife and kids can't **stand the sight of me**.  
I lost a game of **euchre** to my granddaughter and told her to fuck herself.  
He **barges** back **to** my life and forces me to rethink everything.  
So, did it **dawn on you** that it's Christmas?  

The mayor is **in cahoots with** the **mobsters** trying to kill me.  
I'm a man, and I don't **grovel** to rats. -  
A clown that has to make a living, almost getting my guts smeared all over an airplane for a bunch of fucking **ghouls** with tiny little lives.  

Let's go, captain **skin flick**.  
Father Pat gonna talk with you about your dangerous obsession with **spookiness** and the **occult**. -  
Daddy says church is 58 minutes BS and 2 minutes of **shakedown**.  
I'll be out in **pews**.  
It's a metaphor, **numbnuts**!  
It's an **inanimate** object, and it happens to mean a lot to me. And for your own **edification**, I didn't find where it gets. I'm done with that. -   
I know you're pretty **torn up** about Alice.  
Not your fucking father. - I'm drunk, not **concussed**. -  

I shouldn't have called Frank a **balding** piece of shit.  
Sue! You're fucking my **Sensei**? Does Frank knows about this?  


**Lavatories** are for paying customers only. -  
Looks like somebody got **bludgeoned** with a happy club. -  
Holy shit, it's that kid who **narced** on me about a train crash I caused.  
Is this the **payback** for the time I had relations with your **full-sized** sister?  
Should I have, I don't know, **blurted** it out at a wedding?  
I taught you the **fake crying bit**, it doesn't work on me.  

I have to stop them from being so **chummy**.  
To drive my **snotty** kids to the grocery store, to get the fancy cranberries that I hate, jut to help her bring you two back together.   
Leave that alone, you **hobo**. -  
Alright, put your **binky** in the bowl, and **come on in**.  
It's in the **Talmud**, and that's what I'm **counting on**.  
We can discuss your future in **smut** over a Nicoise salad.  
I'm all **worked up**.  
Hop in, I'll give you a **lift**.  
The **impound** lot's next to the **slaughterhouse**.  
Being a slave must be **zany**. -  

> Don't let yourself become a **hostage of your past**.  
That wound will **scab** and you'll want to pick it, till you get a bigger wound and a bigger scab.  

Got forgives many sins, but not **arson**.  


You're full of **shimmering** energy.  
There will be a brief **intermission**.  
Do you mean it? You better not be **joshing** me. Oh, we're gonna have fun, Frank.  

I didn't get discouraged. I played by the rules, and I **bided** my time.  
Frank, gently massage Sue's belly, like a dolphin **twirling** with the current.  
I knew those crooks would **cook up** a way to fuck me out of this election.  

Isn't there maybe some other ways, that isn't so... I don't know, **barbaric**?  
**voodoo**. 
Sorry for that **nutjob**.  
Remember to keep your head up, you redhead **fag**!  
He's getting all **flustered**. He's the angriest person I've ever seen.  

Stop **bottling up** your feeling.  
She is **jumpy** today.  
Do you think Kevin's song **has what it takes**?  
I was **head over heals** about her.  
But to this date, I thank my father for **looking out for me**.  
He saved me from **throwing my life away** for some silly **infatuation**.  
My father **turned me in** to the **Gestapo**. - Oh, year, that's the winner.  
Got to **put another fire out**.  


That's pure **lye**.  
He's been **grouch** ever since Grandpa came around and started buying us ice cream every day.  
She will be **upstate** with a **distended** belly by next summer.  
You're an **ignoramus** a **bumbling** liquor thief.  

Would it to kill you to give me an **attaboy**.  
Something would always **set him off**.  
Look at you, a **dead ringer** for your father.  

You're **grounded** forever.  
It's such a terrible **hullabaloo**. When the ambulance came, Otto and I were in bed.   
**Buster**, I love that little **rascal** with all my heart.  

Avoid loud and aggressive person, they're **vexations** to the spirit.  
I couldn't help noticing her **udders**.   

Just a little **good-natured** **ribbing**, Frank.  
I got **indigestion** from that **truck tire** you called a steak.   

Why don't you just drive him up to the Make-out Mountain and **queer off** with each other?  
He was probably just **letting off** some **steam**.  
You really do know these guys, I thought you were **full of shit**.  
No, he didn't! He's acting like a **goon**!  
Well, you were **showboating** around like a smack-ass Cuban!  


We got a **mutiny** going on here?  
Frank, this is all **substandard**.  
Looks a bit **warped**, too.  
How dare you invade the **sanctity** of my garbage **pail**!  
I put my heart and soul into the Forkoontula, and she just **tossed** it in with the coffee grounds.   
That's my plane, you want to **take a spin**?  

Don't be **mopey**, we'll do something later.  
It works fine, just **giggle** it.  

I met her after my **squadron** bombed her village.  
Son, you don't know how close you just came to having your **nutsack** **stapled** to your forehead.  

You might wanna to get a **penicillin** shot.  
Made you **flinch**, you **freckled** fairy.  

An absolute animal **in the sack**.  
Those butchers are already **maiming** hostages.  


## E 8 
Jimmy Fitzsimmons is gonna kill you for **fingering** him for that hockey stick you stole.  
How did you know that? Can you **read minds**, too?  
Take **baby steps**, no one's expecting you to **bare your soul**.  
There is something I need to tell you guys, it's been really **weighing on** me.  
I'm a good-looking **broad** and make a decent deviled egg. The end!   
I threw a **hissy fit** at Frank for working a few extra shifts while I abandoned my children just to follow my dream of drying the world's lettuce.  
That's the first step towards healing, allowing us to see that **beneath** your **gruff** exterior, you're actually quite sensitive.  
My **torment** would never end, because I hurt a friend.  


## E 7 

Aw, Christ, another kid **down the drain**.  
I got a job and keep this family fed when **you weren't pulling your weight**.   
You **hocked** our **locket** for your little salad thing?   

I'm being the cool dad now! It's all **groovy**!  
What if we build a **decoy** airport, the same exact size as ours, with plane and everything.  
Christ, she's threatening to take us to a **shrink**!  
Don't do it Kevin, there are so much to **live for**.  
There are 12, one for each **apostle**!

**where's that ever gotten me**?  
You **chipped** my tooth, what the fuck is wrong with you?  
How many of you have to ever had to lie in a **latrine**, pretending to be died?  
Did you drop a **glazed** doughnut on your lap?  

## E 4 

Now, go put on your **crotchless** **apron**, turn on Scooby Doo, and I will be right back to **hop in** your Mystery Machine.  
You're **better off** down there than here.  
Come and get your **slop**.  

## E 3 

I'm pretty sure he **went through** his entire **rolodex**.  
In my experience, the product line is a bit **long in the tooth**, and I believe our customer would embrace an innovative, new product.  
I'm not trying to be a **square**. My kids happen to think I'm cool, but enough is enough. I'm not gonna take any more of this.   
I can make this work, Frank. **Rig up** some wiring, spray some **asbestos**, **slap on** some **lead paint**. Kevin, you will be in heaven **in no time**.  
My mom says that weeds are the **desperadoes** of the garden.  
You give me **the third degree** in front of my children.  


## E 2 

Hey Bill, **don't mind us**.  
When they found me, I was trying to **lactate** myself.  

## E 1 

Looks like your boy **dinged** my **dangler**.  
He is really **down in the dumps**. He is usually so **full of life**.  
Now take these off my check, you bunch of **chiselers**!  

## E 6 

You hear that, you **jackals**?  
Here, **take a swig**. Come on, drink it!  
You **soiled** my **surplice**, you fucking **catamite**!  
I have a dozen **scabs** read to go!  
**pyro**   
I know it's a little **schmaltzy**, but we're a family and now we need to pull together.  


## E 4

Wait, you're gonna **narc** on yourself? Have I taught you nothing?  
She is a **pack rat**, good for business.  
We will **walk out** on Christmas Day.  
I'm getting a **hernia** supporting you, but this part-time job is getting out of control.   
We've had **ups and downs**, sometimes we haven't gotten along...  
And then he **laid down** on top of her, and they wrassled. I think he won.  

## E 3 

Murphy, you tell these **ingrates** that if they don't stop this illegal slow-down...  


## E 2 

Stop **pouting**, you and I would have lots of fun today.  
If they had a class called "future", I'd be **all over it**.  
Not now, I'm being **anointed**.  

And if you see a 6 year old running away from you, He is about to **compromise** your position.  

## E 1 

Mm, this **varnish**. It's so **decadent**.
