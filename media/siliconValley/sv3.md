It's my **Mona Lisa**  
That's **preposterous**  
We're thrilled to be getting into Pied Piper right at this **inflection point**.

you **caked my pants**  
Even **a whiff of** fraud is a **mortal sin** for VCs.  
I'll expect you **off the premises** by end of day  
a firm **no-shop clause**  
as a **contemptible** asshole, you were talking about Erlich?   


## E 9  
You and I have never really had much of a **rapport**, have we?  
It... **wanting**  
Gilfoyle, you **crack me up**  
to do **outreach**, tutorials, user meetups, create a **guerrilla marketing** **campaign** that explains how cool the platform is  
You **tepid** response to our **intrepid** boss makes me ill.  
I'm the **possum** to which I refer. Playing dead to **outwit** those who wish me harm, but it's time to end the **charade**.

we still have few weeks of **runway**  
You **pulled** us **out** of a **nosedive**

## E 7 

It's going to be **rad**  
**Shuttering** a company in the tech world is almost a **rite of passage**, like **herpes simplex** one.

you're accusing me of **impropriety**?  
We may have a healthy **brood** on our hands.  
You're **flipping out**  
I have an inbox full of **raves** here  
I'd like to **vie** for a lesser **sentence** **if after** he makes full **restitution** he would write a very **convincing** public apology.  
that's a **tough sell**  
even for a **plaintiff** who's more, uh, **sympathetic**  
I see two **able-bodied**, entitled young white men...   
**dummy** out an email account in his name, sent a beta request to Hendricks, and then **voila**.  
you're so **needy**  
when we have a totally open and **hedonistic** relationship that allows for behavior like that. (She still lied to me)  

## E 6  

She is **magnificent**  
she could be **hideous**  
maybe now I'll **fan out** my xx, so to speak, and see what pretty **birdies** might share my nest.

The rest is **untoward**  
Who was that gorgeous **gazelle** in the driveway?  
you're the **dogface**  
I'm **on the fence**  


## E 5

**shylock**  
Laurie Bream is out there **gallivanting** around the Valley, interviewing every **dickhole** on Earth for my job.

**motion denied**  
We will be **reconvening** tomorrow  
fuck me **sideways**  
she is **slandering** my tech  

## E 3 

She was pretty **adamant** that the whole box project here at Pied Piper was woefully misguided.  
If I can control Laurie, do you really think I'd be looking out my office door at that **monstrosity**?  
at this time we just have to **roll over** and do it.  
we build a **skunk works**  
If anyone **catched wind** of anything here, we're fucked.  
This is it, **no turning back** now.

you four eyes **turd**  
I stay here for a year, I pay no rent, you have no **recourse**  


## E 1 
You madam, are a **shrew** **of the first order**.  
if I didn't vote to remove you, then Laurie would've **adjourned** the meeting, replace my seat on the board with someone else at Raviga  
That's the **gutsiest** thing I've ever seen.  
why should we give up our shares because he's too much of a **prima donna** to let someone experienced come in  
You're the **belle of the ball**, and these are all your **swains**, hoping for a glimpse of ankle.  
**phonograph**  
I got to warn you though, it's pretty **rad**.  
Your **pumpedness** makes me **pumped**.  
We quit **out of solidarity** with Richard.
