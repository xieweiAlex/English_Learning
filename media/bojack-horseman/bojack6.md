As a recovering addict myself, I was **spellbound**!  

## E 11 
Thank you Mr. Peanutbutter for taking the time to **quench** our queries.  
I have my own **superlative** to announce, I, um...  
That part, I can **take or leave**  
everything **falls apart** and I end up alone.  


##  E 10  
With Todd watching the baby, my work-life balance is **on point**.  
I'm **parched**.  
I do feel lighter, and clearer, but also so **foggy**.  
When you **even out**, we can talk about trying something else, okay?  
I'm clever and **free-spirited**, and a little bit **sardonic**, but not so much that's off-putting. -   


## E 8 
Perhaps one could argue **cloistering** oneself from the world itself is a form of **solipsism** -  
Can you wait until you're out of **earshot** to make your **exasperated** **sighs**, please?  
we're **making amends**.  
There was someone else with her while she was **blotto**. -  
I meant fun energy. I didn't mean change the **choreography**.  


## E 7  
In our **undervalued** overworked existence, we're desperate for any **morsel** of satisfaction. -  
we're **amenable** to these terms.  
There is something I feel I must **get off my chest**.  
She is **circling around**, **portending** my **doom**? -  
Is she gonna **swoop in** and **peck out** my chances?  

## E 6  
It appears we're in an **impasse**.  
You know, like how we **satiate** TV creators.  
You could give me some real therapy last 6 months instead of just **plying** me with **folksy** **aphorisms**.  

## E 5 
Unless somebody can **slurp** up all that ice cream!  
You gave a whole **spiel** just trying to get rid of me make room for a **high-profile** new client.  
you **soothe** our egos, and you let us abuse you.  
Sara Lynn got her hands on some alcohol. Her mother is **apoplectic**.  


## E 3 
thank you for helping me with my one bed **bit**.  
I guess letter writing is **therapeutic**.  
local **cameraman** has a pretty good thing going, where he gets travel all over the country, and **fool around** in hotel rooms with his beautiful, smart, **feisty** producer....  

## E 1 
You understand a joke about **deflection** is still a **deflection**, right?  
Just a little bit more **punch**, trust me, it will **loosen you up**.
