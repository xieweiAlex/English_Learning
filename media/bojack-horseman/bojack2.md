this isn't funny, no more **tomfoolery**  
**trigonometry**, advanced physics, or at the movies with Mr. Peanutbutter  
when he gets excited, his ears so slightly **flop up** and **give him away**. 

## E 7 
**hippo**  
What you got against Uncle Hanky, you **uppity** **cooze**?   
I'm not **slinking** away  
I'm so **incorrigible**. -  
everybody thinks he is a nice guy, people don't want to think he **is capable of** awful things, so they let him **off the hook**.  
Hey **turtleneck**, you're fired.  
I wanted to pitch you an **expose** on Hank Hippopolaous  
I'd love to **take down** Hippopolaous and finally **topple** the **acropolis** of **monstrous** **hypocrisy** that **ensconces** us. -   
you gonna **drag down** people close to you.  
A **genocide** may or may not have been **perpetrated** in my name. -  
I'm **in your corner**


## E 6  
**Ever since** I heard about that agent who died from that blue-face **blastoff**?  
Are you saying you want tot **auto-erotic** **asphyxiate** yourself?  
If I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna go **all out**.  
what a **hoot**  

## E 4, E 5  
Jump out of the window, **shimmy** down the **drainpipe** and wait in the car.  
I'm still **getting up to speed**  
Finding out Sinatra was dead was a real **curveball**.  
**mulch**  
I think maybe there's some things we kind of **glossed over** as we rushed into this relationship.  
A deer in **arrears**. -  
**fowl** **run afoul**  
Let's **bust her out**  
Does she have a **meadow** that Becca can **frolic** around in?  

## E 3  
Thank you, Tina, for those touching **grunts** and **growls**.  
In his last days, Herb's cancer had gone into **remission**.  
I was wondering where you **wandered off** to.  
But I do know a **hot ticket**  
let's get some light in here, it's so **dreadfully** **dreary**.  
He was a **peculiar** client.  
the network said it was too **edgy**.  
I never met the guy. I'm just here to **schmooze** -  
you **blew up** again, **dweeb**.  
if you are being **zonked up** all the time, I'm not sure I can trust you with the responsibility.  
I'm remembering a lot of stuff. The **ketamine**'s **wearing off**.  
Do you mean I'm a "killer of **gloom**"?  
it would make Herb a **laughingstock**  
ABC sent us **limousines** to take us to the wrap party.  
I never been in a **limo**  


## E 1, E 2 
Oh, big **stud**, **running off** to **gallivant** with your **fillies**. 
I gotta say the "new you" seems a little **on edge**  
Now grab the **binoculars**. I need dirt on Wanda's new gentleman friend.  
So "Disneyland" is still **up for grabs**?    
No, we just took you at **face value**  
I want to **swing for the fences**, you know?
