Oh, big **stud**, **running off** to **gallivant** with your **fillies**. 
I gotta say the "new you" seems a little **on edge**  
Now grab the **binoculars**. I need dirt on Wanda's new gentleman friend.  
So "Disneyland" is still **up for grabs**?    
No, we just took you at **face value**  
I want to **swing for the fences**, you know?
