I'm clearing my **docket**, this is my only priority.  
I still think it's pretty **nutty** we both have the left half of a **medallion**.  
You physically **overpowered** me.  

## E 11 
I still have this little **rancid** **itch** saying something isn't right. -  
Your concern is very **touching** by the way.   
Look at you, **skulking** behind doors with a **malevolent** **aura**. -  
someone is trying to **take me down**, take the show down.  
I guess some of this detective stuff is starting to **rub off on** me, because I figured out what's been going on with you.  

## E 10

Blunt? - Well, she is a little **curt**.  
**no dice**  

## E 8 
I deserve to be adored by a man, yet here my dreams lie **dormant**!  
I like that you're **razzing** me.  
**full of life**  
Why do all these idealistic, **vivacious** women eventually turn bitter and cruel after being with me?  
What's the **common denominator**?  
I'm gonna go **dry off**, you two **chat it up**.  
So you can **wean** yourself **off** of having fears!  
It was, like, a very **formative** part of my childhood.

Wow. How long was I talking? - I hope that's **cathartic** for you.  
I feel like I was **hogging** whole conversation.  
**whiney baby**  
You literal **knucklehead**.  

## E 6 
You got a **head start** on most kids, you're actually very lucky.  
I was sure that she would get in one final **zinger**, about how I **let her down**, and about how I was fat and stupid.  
 
## E 5 

Just another dumb teenage girl, so **liquored up**, she forgot to make sure her boyfriend **wrapped** his **tweedle**.  
Well, that's all true, but I'm not some **backwoods** **hick**.  
Why aren't they just **skidding** towards the side of the building, and then they **roll off** just as their bikes go **careening** over the edge?   
Everything I **pitch**, he **shoots down**.  
Hey, I got a **nutty** idea, what if you deferred for a year?  

## E 4  

Go to the award show, take down that **skeevy** **so-and-so**, and then during commercial breaks, get in some Hollywoo **hobnobbing**.  
hobnobbing sexual violence, protracted, **lascivious** nude scenes.  
**culpable** for that **complicit**  

## E 1  
Gina, Bojack was concerned the old scene was **gratuitous** and male-gazey. -  
do you feel weird that you don't have **discernible** life direction?  

## Judah 

**pointless** - I guess most of dates are  
I've prepared our agreement, **look it over** and sign it **at your leisure**  
I've a **stack** of holiday cards for the staff. I took the **liberty** of writing little personal things on your behalf.   
I know you're excited, but we're still in a very **precarious** position.  
Jesus Christ, Judah. Do you ever **read a room**?  
I also feel an **ambivalence** about the strike ending.  
The negotiations have been quite **invigorating**.

I was in **mid trek** of a Los Angeles crest when i received your text.
