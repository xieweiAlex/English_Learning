## E 8 
I deserve to be adored by a man, yet here my dreams lie **dormant**! -  
I like that you're **razzing** me. -  
**full of life**  
Why do all these idealistic, **vivacious** women eventually turn bitter and cruel after being with me? -   
What's the common **denominator**?  
I'm gonna go **dry off**, you two **chat it up**.  
So you can **wean** yourself **off** of having fears!  
It was, like, a very **formative** part of my childhood.  

## E 7

I feel like I was **hogging** whole conversation.  
**whiney baby**  
You literal **knucklehead**. -  

## E 6 
You got a **head start** on most kids, you're actually very lucky.

Just another dumb teenage girl, so **liquored up**, she forgot to make sure her boyfriend **wrapped** his **tweedle**.

Everything I **pitch**, he **shoots down**.  
Hey, I got a **nutty** idea, what if you deferred for a year?  

## E 4  

Go to the award show, take down that **skeevy** **so-and-so**, and then during commercial breaks, get in some Hollywoo **hobnobbing**.  
hobnobbing sexual violence, protracted, **lascivious** nude scenes. -  
**culpable** for that **complicit**  

## E 1  
Gina, Bojack was concerned the old scene was **gratuitous** and male-gazey.  
do you feel weird that you don't have **discernible** life direction?  

## Judah 

**pointless** - I guess most of dates are  
I've prepared our agreement, **look it over** and sign it **at your leisure**  
I've a **stack** of holiday cards for the staff. I took the **liberty** of writing little personal things on your behalf.   
I know you're excited, but we're still in a very **precarious** position.  
Jesus Christ, Judah. Do you ever **read a room**?  
I also feel an **ambivalence** about the strike ending.  
The negotiations have been quite **invigorating**.
