My mother, she's **senile**, and she was drugging the coffee.  
Well, this is me giving you the Princess Carolyn **pep talk**.  
**rabies**  
We have zero ballrooms, in this **Thrifty** Lodge.  
You're **willingly** misunderstanding me.  
Well, **onwards and upwards**.  
I guess I will see you **on set**.  
But sometimes, if you **squint** at it just right, everything **lines up**, and it's the most perfect... beautiful, amazing thing.  


## E 11 

You're a reminder of **disparity** of wealth in this county. Poor people find that dreadfully **gauche**.  
I bet your thank-you letters are **perfunctory**, your flower arrangement are **uninspired**, and your courtesy is an embarrassment.  
Can I pay her 5 years **in a lump sum** now, so I don't have to think about her again?  
It'll **dispense** with the need for goodbyes, **thus** **eliminating** my **transgression**.  
If a beautiful creature like herself could ever love an **oaf** like him.  
Why won't you just take that **corner office** job at Sugerman West, instead of breaking your back all day at the **cannery**, and then maybe you could afford me some decent help around here?  
It would only depress me to watch you **bumble** around like that.

> Diane leaks damaging information on Jessica Biel, Todd's clown dentist business **hits a snag**, and Princess Carolyn finds hope in an unlikely place.  

Because the only thing voters care about is stupid bullshit, so **knock yourself out**.  
> somebody said funny and sad are two sides of the same coin.  

I will **send over** a contract, **iron-clad**. I don't want to risk that **jerkwad** skipping town again.    
This is a really **head-scratcher** for me  


## E 9   
I was not trying to engage in **punnery** during business hours.  
This is a priceless family **heirloom**.  
A treasure from the past and a symbol of the **tenacity**. -  
Judah, you'll never guess who I just **ran into**.  
So? What's the **prognosis**?  
I wouldn't **beat yourself up**. **Miscarriages** happen for so many reasons.  
You **went over** my head and **turned him down** without telling me.  
I'm **parched** from all the yelling I've been doing  
I'm just gonna have a quick **nightcap** and go to bed.  
**third degree** much?  
She is **poised** and funny, and tells people about me.   


## E 8 
Your booty's been **adjudicated**! -  
That's so **degrading**  

## E 7 
I'm not waiting around to be rescued like some **chump**.  
**woodchuck**, **beaver**  
Asking for points is **conceited**. That's more points for me. -  
For my crimes, I will be fed to its **ravenous** flames. -  
He's got **moxie** and a soft **thorax**.  
what an **eyesore**.  

## E 6  
It's not like you to be so **testy**. -  
that doll actually belongs to my mom, she is very sick, very **frail**.  
I guess it's a **bad analogy**.  
you care about people more than just yourself. And **for what it's worth**, you will be a wonderful mother.  
I choose my words very carefully, with an eye towards **precision** and **expediency**.  

## E 5  
We both agreed it was the best place for my mom to **run out the clock**  
Oh, **pluck a duck**, it's called Walnut Springs.  
you didn't feel a **twinge of guilt** when you left your mom in this place.  
Eventually, she'll recognize you, and then you can totally **rip into** her.  

## E 4  
You said offices are have corners, and corners are the **patriarchy**.  
Oh, Bojack, do you recall the **impetus** for our **uncoupling**?  
You're the one who **call his bluff**, don't do that. It only makes my work harder.   

## E 3 
Mine is a bunch of water **balloons** with a blonde **wig**.  
Fashion was never meant to be an **inherently** **elitist** form.  
We need to return fashion to its **utilitarian** roots.  

## E 2  

> BoJack goes **off the grid** and **winds up** at his grandparents' **dilapidated** home in Michigan where he reflects on his family legacy and **befriends** another soul **haunted** by the past.

We need to take this **portrait** before you and I both **take a powder**.  
Folks, this is for **posterity**, so don't forget to look far away sad.  
It's a **blight** on the neighborhood  
This is **bound to happen**.  
Hasn't got much use in the last 25 years, except for the **termites**.  
I'm **woefully** unprepared to manage a woman's emotions.  
**weather vane**   
We stole them **fair and square**  
I got a **swell** idea, why don't you drive?  
**don't sweat it**  

## E 1  
I was **hoisted** by my own **petard**, the one petard I thought would never hoist me.
