### The Matrix 

the **informant** is real  
All the time, it's called **mescaline**. It's the only way to fly. -  
You can't scare me with this **gestapo** crap -  
**at last**  
this is a **sparring program** -  
Someone can be **bent**, others and be broken.  
**Sentient** programs  
**sentinel** program

All I see is **Blonde**, **Brunette**, **redhead**.  
I can arrange a much more personalized **milieu**. -  
you're **right on time**  
**know thyself**  
I'm tried of that **jagoff** and all of his bullshit  
Billions of people just living out their lives... **oblivious**  
**ranking officer**  
why isn't the **serum** working? -  
It's **repulsive**, I must get out of here, I must get free.
