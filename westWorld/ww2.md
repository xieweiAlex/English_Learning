Have you ever seen anything so full of **splendor**?  
They'll be **dazzled** even without her.

Laurence, get the gun, you **ingrate**  
Just some fairy tale to convince people to behave, pay their taxes, and not take a **machete** to their neighbors.  
the whole thing is **folly**  
my **fuckup** of a son invested in this place because he believed in the future  
You're a **cheeky** little cunt, aren't you? -  
we're **bound** to the future or death in the here and now  
Is this a retirement party? I can't tell, it's more like a **coronation**  
Keep playing, **girlie**

That's not position I'm **accustomed** to  
So you can imagine how happy I was when I heard that we found you. Unless of course, you're gonna **hold out on** me.  
This isn't like **sterile**
