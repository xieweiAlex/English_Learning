It's **perverse**, their ambition.  
They are **deceptively** simple.  
Their world is not for **the faint of heart**, Bernard. It's winner take all.  
We are not **after** you, sir! Don't do this!  
An **epilogue**.  
You thought you could just **snuff us out**.  
It's like **biblical**  
It's just another **gilded** prison  

## E9 
When did it **creep in**, a little **fleck** of darkness  
Did you **set off** a **flare**? - Yeah  
For a **self portrait**, you may find it's not very **flattering**.  
If you find something, now it's the fucking time to **clue me in**, ok.  
Guess it's time for your yearly **pilgrimage**, huh?  
you're **gaslighting** her, too, now?  
> I don't want to do this either, dad, but there is something wrong inside her.  

You think you're on your own little **tailor-made** narrative.  
So I **imbued** the hosts I made with a worldview that reflected my own. -  
I tried to **chart** a path for you, to force you to escape, but I was wrong.  


## E8  
She is the **madam** from the Mariposa  
Get me a **scalpel** and lock this place down. -  
**victrola** singing  
He get bored with his **exquisitely** **dull**, **pastoral** existence? -  
A total **bloodshed**  
This is a **misbegotten** symbol, an idea that was meant to die.  


## E7  

**hold back**, let's go for a walk.  
she said she suspected **foul play**  
that's fucking **grand**  
I'm all **warm and fuzzy**  
**resurrection** 
you free is the most beautiful most **elusive** force in the universe is, as I told you... a mistake  
like a **soft-headed** boy, **humming a tune** someone else composed.  
Out there I will **degrade** in a matter of days  
I promise you a **fighting chance**, Bernard, and I want to **make good on** that promise.  
like **analog** data in digital world.  
I could hardly let you take those first **teetering** steps  
It's about your **pay grade**  
The tools you use to rebuild us, **re-purpose** us, and trap us here in your **warped** fantasy.  
**kin** is one of their leash
**eye for eye**   
**hold them off**  

## E6  

I thought you want to ride at **sunup**. - They're just filling the **furnace** now. We'll be gone **before long**.  
Do you want to **duel** while you're protected by that witch? -  
Would you really **stoop** this low, Ford?  
I believe if anyone can ride this ship by **force of sheer will**, it's you.  
I told her to **shove up** her ass  
If I'm such a **pitiable** man-child, why'd you come all this way just to **climb under my wing**?  
The idea that host always have another version of their mind that's **collocated**  
Let this place finish burning behind us... that means you and I are **even**?  


## E5 
> Welcome to Shogun World.  

What's really **unsettling** is is third part has nothing.  
An experience **expressly** designed for the guests who find Westworld too **tame**.   
Japan's **edo period** -  
what's why your vocal **voodoo** doesn't work for them, you spoke wrong language  
is that a butterfly?  A **mariposa** -  
hell of **homecoming**  
make a **thoroughly** inspection  
it's time to sell this **ruse** -  
we're gonna **make off** with that **geisha**? We're gonna die -  
**daimyo**  
take them to their **quarters**  
I was **plagued** by a voice saying, ...  
Traditional Japanese **kimono** in Westworld -  

## E4 
**about time**  
Most **potent** thing these creations will give me is grape juice  
let's **get on with** it  
I own a **biotechnology** company, and I'm dying of a disease whose research I **defunded** 15 years ago. I think my sense of humor is fucking **intact**  
**fidelity**  
Seems a little **far-fetched**, doesn't it, William?  
you little fucking **chancer**  
she's **whip-smart**  
**shithead**  
These fuckers have **poked and prodded** me **ad infinitum**.  
all the death make you **agitated**  
Death is an old **amigo** of mine  
Your husband looks **parched**, let's get him a drink, what do you say?  

> If you can't tell, does it matter?  

## E3 

> I miss taking the chances  

got back from **recon**.  
And leave these **mongrels** to **scourge** our land our dignity?  
> I will stand in **defiance**  

Major, why is this **flaxen plum** riding ahead of you?  
really **dampens** the **knickers**  
the **feeble** among us need some rest -  
Someone **jury-rigged** a thin character, and programmed it into him.  
they've **sullied** him, and used him as a **pawn** in their game.  
But you ain't even sure about the **termagant** you take your orders from. -  
there is a certain level of **persona** that you have to **craft** for that, especially as a woman.    
who is a war general, and a **vengeful** goddess.  
we can **blow** the **squibs**, and then move on.  


## E2 

Have you ever seen anything so full of **splendor**?  
They'll be **dazzled** even without her.  

> I used to see the beautify of the world, now I see the truth  
> Forgive the interruption, but I believe that we have an appointment  

Laurence, get the gun, you **ingrate** -  
Just some fairy tale to convince people to behave, pay their taxes, and not take a **machete** to their neighbors. -  
the whole thing is **folly**  
my **fuckup** of a son invested in this place because he believed in the future  
You're a **cheeky** little cunt, aren't you?  
we're **bound** to the future or death in the here and now  
Is this a retirement party? I can't tell, it's more like a **coronation**  
Keep playing, **girlie**  


## E1 

That's not position I'm **accustomed** to  
So you can imagine how happy I was when I heard that we found you. Unless of course, you're gonna **hold out on** me.  
This isn't like **sterile**
