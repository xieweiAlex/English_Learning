> Welcome to Shogun World.  

What's really **unsettling** is is third part has nothing.  
An experience **expressly** designed for the guests who find Westworld too **tame**.   
Japan's **edo period** -  
what's why your vocal **voodoo** doesn't work for them, you spoke wrong language  
is that a butterfly?  A **mariposa** -  
hell of **homecoming**  
make a **thoroughly** inspection  
it's time to sell this **ruse** -  
we're gonna **make off** with that **geisha**? We're gonna die -  
**daimyo** -   
take them to their **quarters**  
I was **plagued** by a voice saying, ...  
Traditional Japanese **kimono** in Westworld -  

## E 4 
**about time**  
Most **potent** thing these creations will give me is grape juice -   
let's **get on with** it  
I own a **biotechnology** company, and I'm dying of a disease whose research I **defunded** 15 years ago. I think my sense of humor is fucking **intact**  
**fidelity**  
Seems a little **far-fetched**, doesn't it, William?  
you little fucking **chancer**  
she's **whip-smart**  
**shithead**  
These fuckers have **poked and prodded** me **ad infinitum**. -  
all the death make you **agitated**  
Death is an old **amigo** of mine -  
Your husband looks **parched**, let's get him a drink, what do you say? -  

> If you can't tell, does it matter?

> I miss taking the chances  

got back from **recon**.  
And leave these **mongrels** to **scourge** our land our dignity? -  
> I will stand in **defiance**  

Major, why is this **flaxen plum** riding ahead of you?  
really **dampens** the **knickers**  
the **feeble** among us need some rest -  
Someone **jury-rigged** a thin character, and programmed it into him. -   
they've **sullied** him, and used him as a **pawn** in their game. -  
But you ain't even sure about the **termagant** you take your orders from. -  
there is a certain level of **persona** that you have to **craft** for that, especially as a woman.    
who is a war general, and a **vengeful** goddess.  
we can **blow** the **squibs**, and then move on. -  


## E 2 

Have you ever seen anything so full of **splendor**? -  
They'll be **dazzled** even without her. -  

> I used to see the beautify of the world, now I see the truth  
> Forgive the interruption, but I believe that we have an appointment  

Laurence, get the gun, you **ingrate** -  
Just some fairy tale to convince people to behave, pay their taxes, and not take a **machete** to their neighbors. -  
the whole thing is **folly** -  
my **fuckup** of a son invested in this place because he believed in the future -  
You're a **cheeky** little cunt, aren't you? -  
we're **bound** to the future or death in the here and now  
Is this a retirement party? I can't tell, it's more like a **coronation**  
Keep playing, **girlie**  


## E 1 

That's not position I'm **accustomed** to  
So you can imagine how happy I was when I heard that we found you. Unless of course, you're gonna **hold out on** me.  
This isn't like **sterile**
