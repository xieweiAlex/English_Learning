## E1 

This is a fairly sizable fucking **blemish**, wouldn't you say?  
The rough edge is the only thing I'm **hanging on**  
for people don't **make the cut**  
People come to our park for sense of danger, now we're **bona fide**. -  
I will summon the **knacker**  
A small town out west, sort of off the **beaten path** -   
Wouldn't have had you **pegged** as a butcher.  
I'm a fucking **figurehead** -  
She was **thorough**, first lab missed it.  
I don't know where your **grifting** little **arse** came from, but this ends your tour of the rich and **feckless**.  
**everyman**
