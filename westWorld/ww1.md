I recommend you **hang back**  
Stop unless you plan to **decommission** the boss  
**Damn right**  
I've seen a few **showdowns** in my day  
A simple handshake would **give them away**  
I saw the new gestures, the **reveries** -  
The **bandit** who **gunned down** the **marshal** is still hiding up there in the hills  
Clearly it's exhibiting some **aberrant** behavior -  
Your host got sick, got lost, but this is **grotesque**  
There are so much as an **unscripted** sneeze, I wan to know about it  
You were only good for writing **depraved** little fantasies -  
Stick in their scripts with minor **improvisations**, this isn't a minor improvisation, this is a fucking shitstorm.  
I suppose **self-delusion** is a gift of **natural selection** as well.  
It also means that you must **indulge** me the occasional mistake.  
I think we best **stay put**  
all the banks and trains around here and you fucking **reprobates** choose to rob us? -  
You're a **low-down** son of bitch  
**cognition** only, no emotional
