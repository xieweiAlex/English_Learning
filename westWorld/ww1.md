About time you realized the **futility** of your situation.  
Your dreams forgotten, your horrors **effaced**

You've been a **scourge** to them, Bernard

We're **on course** for the transition  
This level of **negligence** is fucking **breathtaking**  
**confederados**  
you're the one who would so **blithely** destroy all of them, even him I suppose  

## E 6

Looking for **desperados**.  
Could cut you in if you're **amendable**.  
I asked you **point-blank** if the problem with the update was resolved.  
 if the problem with the update was resolved.  
Is QA surveillance coverage really this **spotty**, or you just like the nature walks?  
Because we never actually bothered to give you one, just a **formless** guilt you will never **atone** for.  
Tight as a **tympani drum**, I reckon
