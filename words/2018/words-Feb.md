the housing **bust** caused them to decline a bit, but then they resumed their steady rise from **nuts** to **crazy** to **batshit insane**.  
I've been through several cycles here and what I've observed is that it doesn't drop **uniformly**.  
Presumably, people who were just slightly priced out of the inner core can now afford to move just a **smidge** closer, people who were in **exurbs** can move to **suburbs**, etc. And things find a new **equilibrium**.  
The **lion’s share** of VC money spent in the US is spent here  
You’d think people would be **fleeing** Napa/Sonoma in **droves**  
In 2000, money was being thrown at **fly-by-night** companies which didn't even make money.  
I can state **unequivocally** that it was not because of this POTUS (although I sure am glad he has no real power **over** me).  
Any people that can continually divide itself against itself, **fomenting** **hatred** of other Americans simply for the sake of money, is not a people that I want to be a part of.
To those of you who are angrily disputing what I wrote, or **smugly** telling me **good riddance**, or **bitterly** denouncing my “hatred” of Americans, I have two things to say:  
**Frugality** is an important value of the company  

Roo is like a little **sunfish** 
He just like **darts** from **place to place**.

**Malaria** must die.  

Netflix is currently paying HEVC **royalties**
AV1 **Mythbusters**

I was honest with her. I don't **pussyfoot**. You know that.  
The researchers **surmised** that the vast expansion of certain **gene** families in the **octopus**, and the network of **linkages** among the genes, could account for the development of its **neurological** complexity.  

Even the relatively small central brain of an octopus is the largest among all **invertebrates**.  

The Falcon Heavy's flight still isn't quite over yet, but the rocket has shown its **prowess**.
These problems can be **ameliorated** by encapsulating the responsibility of the flow into a single object that drives the process from start finish.  

**intermittent**  **periodically** 
I saw a **shimmering** light
