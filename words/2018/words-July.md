This is a huge blow to Amazon and its faux holiday Prime Day.  
It’s not a good look for the world’s largest retailer even though the retailer saw glitches last year, too.  
Other retailers jumped on Amazon’s bandwagon and are running big sales around Prime Day.  
As of this post’s publication, both Walmart and Target are not suffering site outages and probably love Amazon’s outage.

Are your friendships giving you a boost or bringing you down?

The event attracted a group of like-minded travelers who, despite experiencing various levels of adversity in their lives, including cancer, vision loss and the recent loss of a loved one, were remarkably optimistic and upbeat.

Buoyed by the experience, I returned home with a renewed commitment not only to exercise and healthful living, but to simply step up my social life and spend more time hanging out with happy people  
a group of five friends who offer social, logistic, emotional and even financial support for a lifetime.  
You stack the deck in favor of a long-term relationship.  
With the support of her family and friends, and her own tenacity, she was able to support her family, and she eventually remarried.  
When I was growing up we were not affluent, and the four of us lived in a one-bedroom apartment, and my parents slept on a pullout sofa.  

But...that narrative doesn't exist, it's a strawman.  
The $100K on ads wasn't the operation, it was an expenditure to recruit unwitting agents for the operation  







To call someone a sheep is to call them stupid and — more pointedly — stupidly obedient and in thrall to some bad shepherd.  

Lullaby 
Lullaby by François Nicholas RissLa Berceuse (œuvre de William Bouguereau - XIXe siècle)
A lullaby or cradle-song, also spelled cradle song, is a soothing song or piece of music, usually played or sung to children or adults. The purposes of lullabies vary. In some societies they are used to pass down cultural knowledge or tradition. In addition, lullabies are often used for the developing of communication skills, indication of emotional intent, maintenance of infants' undivided attention, modulation of infants' arousal, and regulation of behavior. Perhaps one of the most important uses of lullabies is as a sleep aid for infants. As a result, the music is often simple and repetitive. Lullabies can be found in many countries, and have existed since ancient times.

Cream Pie
A cream pie is a type of pie or cake filled with a rich **custard** or **pudding** that is made from milk, cream, **flour**, and eggs. It can come in many forms, including **vanilla**, lemon, **lime**, peanut butter, banana, coconut, and chocolate. A constant feature of all cream pies is the **whipped cream** **topping**. The custard filling is related to the French crème patissière which is a key component of various French cakes and **tarts**. It is a one-crust pie. The crust may be a standard pie crust made with flour and lard, or one made from crumbled cookies or graham crackers.

But it **ought to** be supported, yes.

My Recruiting **Funnel** 
My **yield** was low. Less than five percent of companies responded to me. I was throwing applications into a black hole.
Everything changed when one of my cohort-mates, a former recruiter, shared a guide to the job search. He told us to send emails directly to real people with each application. It could be anybody. As long as someone read it.

As of Xcode 7 Beta 2, UI Testing shows promise. It's reliable, the querying engine is powerful, and it's more future-proof than any third-party library can realistically be. However, it does have some **quirks**  


**Conformity** is the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to **group norms**. Norms are implicit, **unsaid rules**, shared by a group of individuals, that guide their interactions with others. This **tendency** to conform **occurs** in small groups and/or society as a whole, and may result from **subtle** **unconscious** influences, or direct and **overt** social pressure. Conformity can occur in the presence of others, or when an individual is alone. For example, people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television, even when alone.  

These UI testing features have been around for a few years, but have been **dismissed** by many developers as unstable, **flaky** and hard to use.  

That might work. I'll **scrounge** around for new ones, but if nothing comes up, I'll grab them. Thanks.  


In a lawsuit filed in Florida, one accused Caporella of “unjustified, **unwarranted** and **uninvited** **grabbing**, **rubbing** and **groping** of [his] leg in a sexual manner, reaching up towards [his] sexual **organs**,” according to the Journal’s Jennifer Maloney and Mark Maremont. In a separate Florida lawsuit, the other accused Caporella of grabbing him “under his **armpit**, under his **thigh** and moving his right hand up [his] left leg towards his **genitals**.” One of the cases was settled out of court, according to the Wall Street Journal.

**sparkling water** (**Carbonated** water)
Carbonated water (also known as **club soda**, soda water, sparkling water, **seltzer water**, or **fizzy water**) is water into which **carbon dioxide** gas under pressure has been dissolved. Some of these have **additives** such as **sodium** (seltzer water is almost always composed of water and carbon dioxide with no other additives). This process, known as **carbonation**, is a process that causes the water to become **effervescent**. Most carbonated water is sold in ready to drink bottles as **mineral water** and carbonated beverages such as soft drinks. However, it is rather easy to prepare at home with soda makers.

So if you get out of college and you’re questioning the **marketability** of your degree, or if you've never been to college, a coding bootcamp is something to consider.  
That all being said, I’m also a hiring manager on a web team, and I've been trying to hire people **nonstop** for the last couple of years.  
We love to see **lifelong** learners, and someone who had the **wherewithal** and discipline to take additional courses is going to stand out.  

My hiring practice may be **counterproductive**, but it is what it is. If the result is that I get employees who spent time learning to be interviewed rather than learning what they’ll most likely use on the job, so be it. I’m stuck in my **rut**.  

Even if my **emphatic** recommendation could **sway** them to reconsider, he would surely get rejected in the later stages of the hiring process.  

When we returned home, we noticed that the front window and **patio** door were open.  

First of all, **pat** yourself **on the back** for asking this question. So many engineers **agonize** about DS/Algos in interviews.  
No, we cannot, because however **sub-optimal** the act is, it at least gives us, the hiring managers, a mental satisfaction of trying our best.  
Isn’t it amazing when you can free the candidate from their past and just have them **showcase** their skills? Schools, **pedigree** - why should all that matter?
But you know what, companies don’t care much about losing **false negatives**, because they have a steady supply of people who are happy preparing for and going **thru** this process!
