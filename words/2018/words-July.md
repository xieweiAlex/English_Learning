Poison pill 
A shareholder rights plan, colloquially known as a "poison pill", is a type of defensive tactic used by a corporation's board of directors against a takeover. Typically, such a plan gives shareholders the right to buy more shares at a discount if one shareholder buys a certain percentage or more of the company's shares. The plan could be triggered, for instance, if any one shareholder buys 20% of the company's shares, at which point every shareholder (except the one who possesses 20%) will have the right to buy a new issue of shares at a discount. If every other shareholder is able to buy more shares at a discount, such purchases would dilute the bidder's interest, and the cost of the bid would rise substantially. Knowing that such a plan could be activated, the bidder could be disinclined to take over the corporation without the board's approval, and would first negotiate with the board in order to revoke the plan.

homeostasis
Homeostasis or homoeostasis is the property of a system in which variables are regulated so that internal conditions remain stable and relatively constant. Examples of homeostasis include the regulation of temperature and the balance between acidity and alkalinity (pH). Human homeostasis is the process that maintains the stability of the human body's internal environment in response to changes in external conditions.

While in school, Ive was diagnosed with **dyslexia**, but it never seriously effected his education.  
  
These are **baby-doll** **Southdowns**, and yes, they’re exactly as cute as they look in this picture. We only have four today on our “farm”, as sheep have a **knack** for killing themselves in what would almost be **comical** fashion if it weren’t so sad.  
It’s **so-so** wool because the Southdowns were **bred** for their meat, not their **fleece**.  
They are extremely intelligent in this **other-regarding** way.  
My sheep **roam** freely on the farm, and I never worry about them so long as they stay together, which they always do.  
That’s the difference between a **flock** and a **pack**. A flock is a social structure designed to promote **other-awareness**. It has no goals, no coordinating purpose other than communication. A flock simply IS. A pack, on the other hand, is a social structure designed to **harness** self-aware animals in service to some goal requiring joint action — the raising of **cubs**, the hunting of meat, etc. Both the flock and the pack are extremely effective social structures, but they operate by entirely different logic.  
We think we are wolves, living by the logic of the **pack**.  
In truth we are sheep, living by the logic of the flock.

Speaking as your neighbour to the north, **Vancouver** has a similarly horrible **NIMBY** **zoning** problem.  
All the grey areas are single-family only zoning. Just **eye-balling**.  
I have never understood this **paradox**.  
They are already rich **by virtue of** the property they own, so you would have to **revise** this to be "would become even more rich", which is more **illuminating**  
The paradox you talk about is **well-known**. Property owners often don't sell their property even when it seems **advantageous** to do so, both for them and for the economy **in general**.  
Of course, this idea has a lot of obvious **drawbacks**, but I thought it was an interesting thought to discuss.  
Property is **Monopoly**  
It's like some of the comment seen for the **Ontario** election.  
Different individuals naturally have different **red lines** - some might not want to see a historic single-family house neighborhood **demolished** to make apartment buildings.  
I’ve heard this referred to as “**drawbridge thinking**” in cases where someone moves to an area, makes sure they have access to whatever they want, and then essentially **pulls up** the “drawbridge” and says, “No new outsiders allowed! It’s too crowded here!”  
It's really hard for people who move to California and don't hang out with retirees (**aka** voters) to understand/appreciate this **mindset**. But it's so **prevalent**.

**Lullaby**  
Lullaby by François Nicholas RissLa Berceuse (œuvre de William Bouguereau - XIXe siècle)  
A lullaby or **cradle-song**, also spelled cradle song, is a **soothing** song or piece of music, usually played or **sung** to children or adults. The purposes of lullabies vary. In some societies they are used to **pass down** cultural knowledge or tradition. In addition, lullabies are often used for the developing of communication skills, indication of emotional intent, maintenance of infants' **undivided** attention, **modulation** of infants' **arousal**, and regulation of behavior. Perhaps one of the most important uses of lullabies is as a sleep aid for infants. As a result, the music is often simple and **repetitive**. Lullabies can be found in many countries, and have existed since ancient times.

The custard filling is related to the French crème patissière which is a key component of various French cakes and **tarts**. It is a one-crust pie. The crust may be a standard pie crust made with flour and lard, or one made from crumbled cookies or graham crackers.

As of Xcode 7 Beta 2, UI Testing shows promise. It's reliable, the querying engine is powerful, and it's more future-proof than any third-party library can realistically be. However, it does have some **quirks**  
   
   
**Conformity** is the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to **group norms**. Norms are implicit, **unsaid rules**, shared by a group of individuals, that guide their interactions with others. This **tendency** to conform **occurs** in small groups and/or society as a whole, and may result from **subtle** **unconscious** influences, or direct and **overt** social pressure. Conformity can occur in the presence of others, or when an individual is alone. For example, people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television, even when alone.  
   
These UI testing features have been around for a few years, but have been **dismissed** by many developers as unstable, **flaky** and hard to use.  
   
That might work. I'll **scrounge** around for new ones, but if nothing comes up, I'll grab them. Thanks.

In a separate Florida lawsuit, the other accused Caporella of grabbing him “under his **armpit**, under his **thigh** and moving his right hand up [his] left leg towards his **genitals**.” One of the cases was settled out of court, according to the Wall Street Journal.  
   
**sparkling water** (**Carbonated** water)  
Carbonated water (also known as **club soda**, soda water, sparkling water, **seltzer water**, or **fizzy water**) is water into which **carbon dioxide** gas under pressure has been dissolved. Some of these have **additives** such as **sodium** (seltzer water is almost always composed of water and carbon dioxide with no other additives). This process, known as **carbonation**, is a process that causes the water to become **effervescent**. Most carbonated water is sold in ready to drink bottles as **mineral water** and carbonated beverages such as soft drinks. However, it is rather easy to prepare at home with soda makers.

So if you get out of college and you’re questioning the **marketability** of your degree, or if you've never been to college, a coding bootcamp is something to consider.  
That all being said, I’m also a hiring manager on a web team, and I've been trying to hire people **nonstop** for the last couple of years.  
We love to see **lifelong** learners, and someone who had the **wherewithal** and discipline to take additional courses is going to stand out.  
   
My hiring practice may be **counterproductive**, but it is what it is. If the result is that I get employees who spent time learning to be interviewed rather than learning what they’ll most likely use on the job, so be it. I’m stuck in my **rut**.  
   
Even if my **emphatic** recommendation could **sway** them to reconsider, he would surely get rejected in the later stages of the hiring process.

No, we cannot, because however **sub-optimal** the act is, it at least gives us, the hiring managers, a mental satisfaction of trying our best.  
Isn’t it amazing when you can free the candidate from their past and just have them **showcase** their skills? Schools, **pedigree** - why should all that matter?  
But you know what, companies don’t care much about losing **false negatives**, because they have a steady supply of people who are happy preparing for and going **thru** this process!
