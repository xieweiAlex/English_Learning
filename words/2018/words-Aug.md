The inside has **ridges** and **bumps** for added sensation and I did feel these at times.  
  
GOT III E2  
How would you punish the **infidels**, Eer Davos?  
Take him to the **dungeon** and lock him in a cell.  
Shall I have them bring you a **shawl**, my lady?  
My mother's always had a **penchant** for drama.  
Wheat, **barley**, apples. We've had a blessed harvest.  
To win his **shield**, an **Unsullied** must go to the slave **marts** with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mother's eyes.  
What a soft **mewling** fool this one is.  
You will be fair to them. You won't **mutilate** them to **make a point**.  
The **warlocks**.  
I only know the wall is a **long way off**.  
My mother always told me you **Westerosi** were a **grim** lot. Grim, bearded, **stinking barbarians** that would **row** across Narrow sea and steal us from our beds.  
Will I be wearing **manacles** when I lay my father to rest?  
They **massacred** everyone and put the castle to the **torch**.  
I'm here to take you to King's Landing, and bring back Lady Stark's daughters **in exchange**. **Dull** is fine.  
You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant **towheaded** **plank** following her around for the rest of her life?  
I'm not interested in **foul** rumors.  
His **proclivities** were the worst kept secret at **court**.  
**Staying off** the king's road, are you?  
I wouldn't **tangle** with you.  
**Margaery Tyrell** **dotes** on **filthy** **urchins** for a reason.  
She dresses like a **harlot** for a reason.  
She married a traitor and known **degenerate** like **Renly** Baratheon for a reason.  
He was very **gallant**.  
Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the **pox**.  
So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his **ragged** little breaths, his coughing, his **whimpering**.  
He is a **warg**. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He is scouting for us.  
**growling** (wolf)  
Having you killed would be the **high point** of his week.  
  
  
The **witting** and **unwitting** **complicity** of the institutions  
**Complicity**  
An individual is complicit in a crime if he is aware of its occurrence and has the ability to stop or report the crime, but fails to do so. As such, the individual effectively allows criminals to **carry out** a crime despite potentially being able to **stop it from happening**, either directly or by contacting the authorities. The **offender** is a **de facto** accessory to the crime, rather than an innocent **bystander**.  
  
Isolation is not only **unnerving**, it is also **widespread**.  
How leading organizations are addressing the loneliness **epidemic**  
Since isolation can be a **taboo** topic, few patients will be **forthcoming**  
  
Smoke testing (also confidence testing, sanity testing,[1] build verification test (BVT)[2][3][4] and build acceptance test) is preliminary testing to reveal simple failures **severe** enough to, for example, reject a **prospective** software release.  
Microsoft claims that after code reviews, "smoke testing is the most **cost-effective** method for identifying and fixing **defects** in software.  
  
The difference between a great taco truck and a **crappy** one isn't **discernible** through typical means.  
**al Pastor** (almost always pork, cooked like **shawarma** on a spit called a trompo with a **chile** sauce)  
**Pescado**  
  
Did you threaten to **subpoena** their calls and e-mails?  
Land **expropriation** without compensation.  
  
Aziz was booked into the Olmsted County Adult Detention Center where he is awaiting **arraignment** on a felony charge of **first-degree** assault.  
Check his **tummy**  
  
The **shakeout** in China’s $192 billion peer-to-peer lending industry is accelerating **at a rapid clip**.  
At least 118 platforms have failed this month through early Friday, according to Shanghai-based Yingcan Group, whose **tally** for July stood at 57 just three days ago.  
China’s **clampdown** on financial risk has weighed on P2P platforms for the past two years, but the pressure has intensified in recent months after the country’s credit markets tightened and the banking regulator issued an unusual warning to savers that they should be prepared to lose all their money in high-yield products. While that has triggered **bouts** of panic among users of smaller P2P platforms, there’s little evidence that the turmoil has spread to more systemically important parts of China’s financial sector.  
Some borrowers have lost their intention and ability to repay their loans, leaving a huge impact on our operations and drying up our **liquidity**.  
Holding an open door to talks while threatening worse consequences represents yet another increase in tension in the months-long standoff between the world’s two largest economies over commerce.  While the conflict nominally centers around the U.S.’s $375 billion annual goods trade deficit with China, it has morphed into a chapter in the nations’ broader strategic rivalry.
