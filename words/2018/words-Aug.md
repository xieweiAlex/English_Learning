**internment**  
Internment is the **imprisonment** or confinement of people, commonly in large groups, without trial. Collins English dictionary adds that the term is especially used for the confinement "of enemy citizens in wartime or of terrorism suspects". Thus, while it can simply mean imprisonment, it tends to refer to **preventive confinement**, rather than confinement after having been convicted of some crime. Use of these terms is subject to debate and political sensitivities.

This **misguided** hiring strategy can also contribute to a company’s lack of diversity, since very often the people we enjoy hanging out with have backgrounds much like our own.  
he was a pretty **buttoned up** guy.

And coming up with compensation that suits the performance you need and the future you **aspire** to.  
**Probe** Beneath the Surface  
At Netflix we had to be creative about where we searched for talent, because we often needed people with **rarefied** technical skills.  
Team members provided input, and my team and I also **weighed in**.  
Netflix was a much sexier place to work, so I was **perplexed**.  
I can’t **bear** the thought of leaving him.  
He had a thick German accent, and he **stuttered**.  
He still **stuttered**, but he gave me a **riveting** explanation, and I realized, That’s it.  
We always tried to be creative about probing people and their résumés. Bethany once decided to analyze the résumés of our best data-science people for common features. She found that those people shared an **avid** interest in music.  
Building a talented team of internal recruiters was a **substantial** investment, but I could make an **irrefutable** business case for doing so.  
The recruiters created a **slide deck** to use with each manager, one-on-one.  
People don’t have to approach interviewing or recruiting in the same way, but we insisted that they have a plan and not just **improvise**.  
All this should be **modeled** from the top.  
We ended up hiring Reed’s guy, and Reed **gloated** about it for years.  
Within minutes he was at my desk, **fuming**. “What the hell?” he demanded.  
It **infuriates** me when hiring managers **dismiss** the value of good HR people.  
So I had an **ironclad rule** that if people saw a stranger sitting alone at headquarters waiting for an interview, they should stop and say, “Hi, I’m ____. Are you here for an interview.  
Recruiters **laid the groundwork**. managers made the offers  
Competitive salaries are obviously needed to **lure** top talent.  
Roles are specialized in ways that survey descriptions cannot account for, and a candidate may have skills, such as good judgment and collaborative **prowess**, that can’t be measured by surveys.  
Compensation departments spend **gobs of time** comparing descriptions and adjusting for other factors.  
I learned this during a period when Netflix was losing people because of **exorbitant** offers from our competitors.  
One day I heard that Google had offered one of our folks almost twice his current pay, and I **hit the roof**. He was a really important guy, so his manager wanted to **counter**  
We **bickered** for days. They kept telling me, “You don’t understand how good he is!” I was having none of it.  
P&L: **Profit and Loss**  
That experience changed how we thought about compensation. We realized that for some jobs we were creating expertise and **scarcity**, and rigidly **adhering** to internal salary ranges could harm our best contributors, who could make more elsewhere  
Well, is this new person going to be able to move us faster, maybe even twice as fast? And when we hire him, **who on your team could take his place** at his former company?” The answers were usually “Yeah, we’ll be able to move much faster” and “**None of them could replace him**, because they don’t have his experience.  
This focus on the **value-add** of an individual star is especially important when a company is **scaling up**.  
Then I asked the question I’ve found to be the most **thought-provoking** in these consultations: “Instead of 150 new people, are you sure you don’t want 75 people whom you pay twice as much because they have twice as much experience and can be higher performers?"  
I’ve found that if you focus **intently** on hiring the best people you can find and pay them top dollar, chances are your business growth will more than **make up** for what you spend on compensation.

There are some **subtleties** when using partial mocks. See partial mocks below.

**portmanteau**  
A portmanteau (/pɔːrtˈmæntoʊ/, /ˌpɔːrtmænˈtoʊ/; plural portmanteaus or **portmanteaux** /-ˈtoʊz/) or portmanteau word is a **linguistic** **blend** of words, in which parts of multiple words, or their phones (sounds), and their meanings are combined into a new word. Originally, the word "portmanteau" refers to a suitcase that opens into two equal sections.

**marinated**  
Marination is the process of soaking foods in a seasoned, often **acidic**, liquid before cooking. The origin of the word **alludes** to the use of **brine** (aqua **marina**) in the **pickling** process, which led to the technique of adding flavor by **immersion** in liquid. The liquid in question, the 'marinade', can be either acidic (made with ingredients such as **vinegar**, lemon juice, or wine) or **enzymatic** (made with ingredients such as pineapple, **papaya**). In addition to these ingredients, a marinade often contains oils, herbs, and spices to further flavor the food items.  
   
   
This delicious **medley** comes with **chickpeas**, celery, cucumbers, **zucchini**, kale, **olives**, red bell pepper, **parsley**, mint, garlic, salt, **veganaise**, lemon juice, black pepper. **red quinoa**, **yellow quinoa**, **scallion**, roasted onion, roasted carrot, roasted celery, roasted eggplant, **dill dressing**, red **radish**. Served with red and **gold beets**, **candied pepitas**, and grilled **tri-tip**, served **medium rare**.  
   
The **tri-tip** is a cut of beef from the bottom **sirloin** subprimal cut. It is a small **triangular** muscle, usually 1.5 to 2.5 lbs. (675 to 1,150g) per side of beef.

An **indemnity** is an obligation by a person (**indemnitor**) to provide compensation for a particular loss suffered by another person (indemnitee).  
   
   
**Truism**  
A truism is a claim that is so obvious or self-evident as to be hardly worth mentioning, except as a reminder or as a **rhetorical** or literary device, and is the opposite of **falsism**.  
   
In philosophy, a sentence which asserts **incomplete** truth conditions for a proposition may be regarded as a truism. An example of such a sentence would be "Under appropriate conditions, the sun rises." Without contextual support –a statement of what those appropriate conditions are –the sentence is true but **incontestable**. A statement which is **true by definition** (for example, the **Lapalissade** "If he were not dead, he would still be alive") would also be considered a truism. This is quite similar to a **tautology** in which the conclusion of a statement is essentially equivalent to its **premise**, a statement that is "true by **virtue** of its logical form alone".  
In the United States alone, about 30 percent of all adults have high blood pressure, and should therefore reduce their **sodium** **intake**. Unfortunately, it’s hard to convince people to eat **bland** food  
He first **dug up** research from the 1970s about people with brain problems that caused them to lose their sense of taste.  
Ranasinghe used that finding as a starting point, and started zapping tongues in the lab.  
He determined the parameters that could produce the simulated tastes of saltiness, sourness, and bitterness.  
The taste of sweetness is hard to produce, he says, and he couldn’t test for the fifth basic taste, umami, because people aren’t familiar enough with it  
Umami (/uˈmɑːmi/), a savory taste, is one of the five basic tastes (together with sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and saltiness).  
Once he understood the parameters of simulated flavors, he worked on an unobtrusive way to send electric current through the tongue.  
For the current study, he also made an electric soup bowl that imparts flavors when people **slurp** directly from the bowl, as most do when consuming miso soup.  
   
In public, he's **roaring** at enemies. In private, he's **brooding over** the Russia investigation. Present Trump is a man on the edge.

The **witting** and **unwitting** **complicity** of the institutions  
**Complicity**  
An individual is complicit in a crime if he is aware of its occurrence and has the ability to stop or report the crime, but fails to do so. As such, the individual effectively allows criminals to **carry out** a crime despite potentially being able to **stop it from happening**, either directly or by contacting the authorities. The **offender** is a **de facto** accessory to the crime, rather than an innocent **bystander**.

At least 118 platforms have failed this month through early Friday, according to Shanghai-based Yingcan Group, whose **tally** for July stood at 57 just three days ago.  
China’s **clampdown** on financial risk has **weighed** on P2P platforms for the past two years, but the pressure has intensified in recent months after the country’s credit markets tightened and the banking regulator issued an unusual warning to savers that they should be prepared to lose all their money in **high-yield** products. While that has triggered **bouts** of panic among users of smaller P2P platforms, there’s little evidence that the turmoil has spread to more systemically important parts of China’s financial sector.  
Some borrowers have lost their intention and ability to repay their loans, leaving a huge impact on our operations and drying up our **liquidity**.  
Holding an open door to talks while threatening worse consequences represents yet another increase in tension in the months-long **standoff** between the world’s two largest economies over commerce.  While the conflict nominally centers around the U.S.’s $375 billion annual goods trade **deficit** with China, it has **morphed** into a chapter in the nations’ broader strategic **rivalry**.
