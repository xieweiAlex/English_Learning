**Endurance** (also related to **sufferance**, **resilience**, constitution, **fortitude**, and **hardiness**) is the ability of an **organism** to **exert** itself and remain active for a long period of time, as well as its ability to resist, **withstand**, recover from, and have **immunity** to trauma, wounds, or **fatigue**. It is usually used in **aerobic** or **anaerobic** exercise. The definition of 'long' varies according to the type of **exertion** – minutes for high intensity anaerobic exercise, hours or days for low intensity aerobic exercise. Training for endurance can have a negative impact on the ability to exert strength unless an individual also undertakes resistance training to **counteract** this effect.

Loras knew his **mare** was **in heat**, quite **crafty**, really.  
No more would he **preen** and **primp**, #n garb of red and gold.    

Very wise, they'll be out **in droves**, looking for me in the wrong place.

Should I **gag** him?

What did your father do? Fucked a cook and **whelped** a whore.  
I suffered an early **mutilation** myself, some doors closed forever, others open in the most unexpected places.    
What sort of **doom** does the King face?  
As clear and **tasteless** as water. It leaves no **trace**.  
John was a **man of peace**.  
He was **hand** for 17 years. -- 17 good years.

And I heard the most **awful** rumor about a certain lord with a taste of fresh **cadaver**. 
**Strictly speaking**, such a thing would not be **in accordance with** the King's laws.

My friends were all so jealous that I got to meet the prime Minister  
One of the best parts about my job is that I get to work from home.  
My English is pretty good, but I'm still too shy to initiate conversations with strangers  
What drove me to succeed was my complete fear of being a nobody  
drove me crazy  
Keep it up.  


The technology behind the **electrification** of the road linking Stockholm Arlanda airport to a **logistics** site outside the capital city aims to solve the **thorny** problems of keeping electric vehicles charged, and the manufacture of their batteries affordable.

Of course, someone has to clean it up, just as our **deficit**.  
So, there you have it. A bit **rambling** and perhaps a bit **tangential**, but that's what Google means to me.  
I can **attest** that getting a job at Google didn't give me **a sense of** **validation** at all, in fact, I'm still a bit **sore** about being rejected by Dropbox. It's just human nature to never be satisfied with what we have.  

Social media sites are littered with seemingly **innocuous** little **quizzes**, games and surveys urging people to **reminisce** about specific topics, such as “What was your first job,” or “What was your first car?” The problem with participating in these informal surveys is that in doing so you may be **inadvertently** **giving away** the answers to “secret questions” that can be used to unlock access to a host of your online identities and accounts.  
I’m willing to bet that a good percentage of regular readers here would never respond — honestly or otherwise — to such questionnaires (except perhaps to **chide** others for responding  
But I thought it was worth mentioning because certain social networks — particularly Facebook — seem positively **overrun** with these **data-harvesting** **schemes**.  
  
An Apple R&D **Bonanza**  
After a brief **lull**, Apple's R&D expenditures are once again **exploding**.  
CAGR: Compound annual growth rate  
As seen in Exhibit 1, the **ramp** in Apple R&D expense **spanning** more than two decades has been **breathtaking**  
As seen in Exhibit 2, beginning in FY2Q17, Apple R&D expense growth has been **on an uptrend**  
The recent **ramp** in R&D expenditures suggests Apple is definitely **up to something**.  
This means that cash spent on developing new versions of existing products may not necessarily qualify as R&D. Instead, such expenses may have to be marked as a capital expenditure and **amortized** or depreciated over the life of the asset.  
Apple is also continuing to work on doubling down on hardware to control the brains powering its products.  
Some of these R&D **outposts** are a result of Apple acquiring teams of talent  
For a company that positions its ability to focus on a few things at any one time as a **core competency**, increased **experimentation** seems to be **at odds with** this value  
  
Since we are large there will be 2 **staggered** groups.  
Please be there at 10:15 AM **at the latest**.  
SFMOMA holds an internationally recognized collection of modern and **contemporary art**.  
SFMOMA reopened on May 14, 2016, following a major three-year-long **expansion** project

Mark Zuckerberg said that the whole argument of the company not caring about its customers and their data because they don’t pay for the service is “extremely **glib**”.  
  
**two-tier** privacy system  
I was kind of **defeated**  
Your application for Engineering **practicum** is still under review  
Cool problems and a **curse** in that their technology is very **proprietary**  
  
The case, which is actually two nearly identical cases, involves two businessmen who were both convicted of **white-collar crimes** in the ’90s, and requested that Google **delist** several URLs referencing their **convictions**, including news articles.  
Even as a legal **sleight of hand**, the argument is quite a departure from Google’s **customary** efforts to present itself as a **disinterested** **arbiter** of information, a position that has become more **untenable** with time.  
Gareth Corfield, a reporter for The Register who covered the cases from the **courtroom**, said it’s **disingenuous** of Google to put on the **mantle** of journalism only when it suits them.  

Apple has made and caution about future decisions made in the name of “security” while potentially hiding questionable motives.  
iOS **subliminally** and constantly collects sensitive data, links it to hardware identifiers almost guaranteed to link to a real identity  
Controversial, **draconian** surveillance laws being implemented worldwide which could take advantage of Apple’s data collection and OS design choices, notably in, but not limited to, China, one of Apple's largest markets.  
One major benefit on iOS is that that the encryption is tied to the secure **enclave**  
   
Do the motorcycle riders a favor and put the orange **cone** in the space.  
   
Surgeon general issues rare advisory: more people should carry **opioid** **overdose** **antidote**.  
Authorities are searching for a man who **burglarized** his parents home in San Jose on Wednesday, stole a **shotgun** and left behind a 20-page manifesto.  
A family in San Jose said they came back home from vacation to find that their **estranged** son, Dustin Hamilton
