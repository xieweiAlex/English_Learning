Good-natured and self-confident, she typically wore the kind of outfit—jeans, hoodie, sneakers—that **signals** coding **gravitas**.  
Yet every time Blount asked him a question about his skills or tried to steer the conversation to the scope of the job, he **blew her off** with a **flippant** comment.  
In the **hierarchy** of **sexist encounters**, it didn't rank very high.  
One reason her career had gone so well, she thinks, is that she'd made a point of ignoring **slights** and **oafish** comments.  
She still heard talk about how hiring women or people of color **entailed** “lowering the bar”.  
The job **entails** precision  
She was teaching herself to code as a teenager, she was too naive to **perceive** the **sexism** of internet culture.

Vehicle **extrication** is the process of removing a vehicle from around a person who has been involved in a motor vehicle accident, when conventional means of exit are impossible or **inadvisable**. A delicate approach is needed to minimize injury to the victim during the extrication. This operation is typically accomplished by using **chocks** and bracing for stabilization and **hydraulic** tools, including the **Jaws of Life**. Standards and regulations can be found in NFPA 1670 and 1006.

In that case, well, we will all be **fabulously** wealthy and we can all consider this a **monotonous**, while **virtuous**, **fire drill**.

**Illiberal democracy**  
An illiberal democracy, also called a partial democracy, low intensity democracy, empty democracy, or hybrid regime, is a governing system in which, although elections take place, citizens are **cut off** from knowledge about the activities of those who exercise real power because of the lack of **civil liberties**. It is not an "**open society**". There are many countries "that are categorized as neither 'free' nor 'not free', but as 'probably free', falling somewhere between democratic and nondemocratic regimes". This may be because a constitution limiting government powers exists, but its liberties are ignored, or because an adequate legal constitutional framework of liberties does not exist.

**Accountability**  
In ethics and governance, accountability is answerability, blameworthiness, liability, and the expectation of account-giving. As an aspect of governance, it has been central to discussions related to problems in the public sector, nonprofit and private (corporate) and individual contexts. In leadership roles, accountability is the acknowledgment and assumption of responsibility for actions, products, decisions, and policies including the administration, governance, and implementation within the scope of the role or employment position and encompassing the obligation to report, explain and be answerable for resulting consequences.

An **erratum** or **corrigendum** (plurals: errata, corrigenda) (comes from Latin: errata corrige) is a correction of a published text. An erratum is most commonly issued shortly after its original text is published. Patches to security issues in a computer program are also sometimes called errata. As a general rule, publishers issue an erratum for a production error (i.e., an error introduced during the publishing process) and a corrigendum for an author's error.

Poison pill  
A shareholder rights plan, colloquially known as a "poison pill", is a type of defensive tactic used by a corporation's board of directors against a takeover. Typically, such a plan gives shareholders the right to buy more shares at a discount if one shareholder buys a certain percentage or more of the company's shares. The plan could be triggered, for instance, if any one shareholder buys 20% of the company's shares, at which point every shareholder (except the one who possesses 20%) will have the right to buy a new issue of shares at a discount. If every other shareholder is able to buy more shares at a discount, such purchases would dilute the bidder's interest, and the cost of the bid would rise substantially. Knowing that such a plan could be activated, the bidder could be disinclined to take over the corporation without the board's approval, and would first negotiate with the board in order to revoke the plan.

homeostasis  
Homeostasis or homoeostasis is the property of a system in which variables are regulated so that internal conditions remain stable and relatively constant. Examples of homeostasis include the regulation of temperature and the balance between acidity and alkalinity (pH). Human homeostasis is the process that maintains the stability of the human body's internal environment in response to changes in external conditions.

It’s **so-so** wool because the Southdowns were **bred** for their meat, not their **fleece**.  
They are extremely intelligent in this **other-regarding** way.  
My sheep **roam** freely on the farm, and I never worry about them so long as they stay together, which they always do.  
That’s the difference between a **flock** and a **pack**. A flock is a social structure designed to promote **other-awareness**. It has no goals, no coordinating purpose other than communication. A flock simply IS. A pack, on the other hand, is a social structure designed to **harness** self-aware animals in service to some goal requiring joint action — the raising of **cubs**, the hunting of meat, etc. Both the flock and the pack are extremely effective social structures, but they operate by entirely different logic.  
We think we are wolves, living by the logic of the **pack**.

A lullaby or **cradle-song**, also spelled cradle song, is a **soothing** song or piece of music, usually played or **sung** to children or adults. The purposes of lullabies vary. In some societies they are used to **pass down** cultural knowledge or tradition. In addition, lullabies are often used for the developing of communication skills, indication of emotional intent, maintenance of infants' **undivided** attention, **modulation** of infants' **arousal**, and regulation of behavior. Perhaps one of the most important uses of lullabies is as a sleep aid for infants. As a result, the music is often simple and **repetitive**. Lullabies can be found in many countries, and have existed since ancient times.

The custard filling is related to the French crème patissière which is a key component of various French cakes and **tarts**. It is a one-crust pie. The crust may be a standard pie crust made with flour and lard, or one made from crumbled cookies or graham crackers.

Conformity can occur in the presence of others, or when an individual is alone. For example, people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television, even when alone.  
   
These UI testing features have been around for a few years, but have been **dismissed** by many developers as unstable, **flaky** and hard to use.  
   
That might work. I'll **scrounge** around for new ones, but if nothing comes up, I'll grab them. Thanks.  
   
   
In a lawsuit filed in Florida, one accused Caporella of “unjustified, **unwarranted** and **uninvited** **grabbing**, **rubbing** and **groping** of [his] leg in a sexual manner, reaching up towards [his] sexual **organs**,” according to the Journal’s Jennifer Maloney and Mark Maremont. In a separate Florida lawsuit, the other accused Caporella of grabbing him “under his **armpit**, under his **thigh** and moving his right hand up [his] left leg towards his **genitals**.” One of the cases was settled out of court, according to the Wall Street Journal.  
   
**sparkling water** (**Carbonated** water)  
Carbonated water (also known as **club soda**, soda water, sparkling water, **seltzer water**, or **fizzy water**) is water into which **carbon dioxide** gas under pressure has been dissolved. Some of these have **additives** such as **sodium** (seltzer water is almost always composed of water and carbon dioxide with no other additives). This process, known as **carbonation**, is a process that causes the water to become **effervescent**. Most carbonated water is sold in ready to drink bottles as **mineral water** and carbonated beverages such as soft drinks. However, it is rather easy to prepare at home with soda makers.  
   
Was this a conspiracy to **sabotage** Khali the Killer before it hits theaters?  
   
Things are just getting really **wonky** you don't really necessary want to close your terminal.  
   
So if you get out of college and you’re questioning the **marketability** of your degree, or if you've never been to college, a coding bootcamp is something to consider.  
That all being said, I’m also a hiring manager on a web team, and I've been trying to hire people **nonstop** for the last couple of years.  
We love to see **lifelong** learners, and someone who had the **wherewithal** and discipline to take additional courses is going to stand out.  
   
My hiring practice may be **counterproductive**, but it is what it is. If the result is that I get employees who spent time learning to be interviewed rather than learning what they’ll most likely use on the job, so be it. I’m stuck in my **rut**.  
   
Even if my **emphatic** recommendation could **sway** them to reconsider, he would surely get rejected in the later stages of the hiring process.  
   
When we returned home, we noticed that the front window and **patio** door were open.  
   
First of all, **pat** yourself **on the back** for asking this question. So many engineers **agonize** about DS/Algos in interviews.  
No, we cannot, because however **sub-optimal** the act is, it at least gives us, the hiring managers, a mental satisfaction of trying our best.  
Isn’t it amazing when you can free the candidate from their past and just have them **showcase** their skills? Schools, **pedigree** - why should all that matter?  
But you know what, companies don’t care much about losing **false negatives**, because they have a steady supply of people who are happy preparing for and going **thru** this process!
