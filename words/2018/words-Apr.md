One of my men **interfered**, **speared** him through the leg before I could finish him.  
When you hear them whispering "**Kingslayer**" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?  
**Reckless**  
If another house can seize one of our own, and hold him captive with **impunity**, we are no longer a house to be feared.  
I need you to become the man you were always **meant** to be.  
Is that you called me here, to pose me **riddles**?  
The Targaryens **wed** brothers and sisters for 300 years.  
In the **rare event** that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to **stumble** drunk into my bed.  
Your sister was a **corpse** and I was a girl and he loved her more than me.  
Because wherever you go, Robert's **wrath** will follow you.  
When you play Game of Thrones, you win or you die, there is no **middle ground**.

**impudent**. It means rude, disrespectful  
Are the two **mutually exclusive** in your experience?  
One blast for a ranger returning, two for **wildings**.  
My fault, too much wine, missed the **thrust**.  
Give him milk of the **poppy**.  
He was **reeling** from the wine.  
Whatever arrangement you made, **unmake** them **at once**.  
But brother was a fool I know, but he was the right **heir** to the Seven Kingdoms.  
There's honor in being a **steward**.  
The penalty for the **desertion** is death.  
Stewards are nothing but **maids**.  
He wants to **groom** you for command.  
Do you have a **shred** of honor.  
My price would the **modest**.  
  
We only **make peace** with our enemies, my lord.  
But it's not honorable so the words **stick in your throat**.

In modern psychology, Machiavellianism is one of the **dark triad personalities**, characterized by a **duplicitous** **interpersonal** style, a **cynical disregard** for morality and a focus on **self-interest** and **personal gain**.

Can we still have a GDPR **moratorium**, asks US domain-name body  
The letter also has **harsh** words for ICANN's proposed **interim** solution, criticizing its **vagueness** and **noting** it needs to include **explicit** wording about what can be done with registrant data, as well as introduce **auditing** and **compliance** functions to make sure the data isn't being **abused**.  
So we need to **dig into** the **justifications** in terms of our **bylaws** and mission and **remit**.  
It is very important for us to have a **moratorium** and be able to say to our contracted parties 'if you implement this model, you will be in full compliance'," he noted. "We need some kind of **relief**.

In a grand hotel **ballroom** on Tuesday, Huawei executives laid out a **soaring** vision for the future.  
Last week, the company laid off five American employees, including William B. Plummer, the executive who was the face of its **Sisyphean** efforts to win over Washington.  
Huawei has also been **dialing back** its political **outreach** in the United States, these people said — which could end a decade of mostly **fruitless** efforts to **dispel** Washington’s **accusations** that the company has ties to the Chinese government.  
Huawei’s troubles in the United States have been **mounting** since 2012, when a **congressional** report warned that its gear could be used to spy on Americans or to destabilize American telecom networks. The company spent $1.2 million on lobbying that year. Last year, it spent $60,000 on such efforts.

**Endurance** (also related to **sufferance**, **resilience**, constitution, **fortitude**, and **hardiness**) is the ability of an **organism** to **exert** itself and remain active for a long period of time, as well as its ability to resist, **withstand**, recover from, and have **immunity** to trauma, wounds, or **fatigue**. It is usually used in **aerobic** or **anaerobic** exercise. The definition of 'long' varies according to the type of **exertion** – minutes for high intensity anaerobic exercise, hours or days for low intensity aerobic exercise. Training for endurance can have a negative impact on the ability to exert strength unless an individual also undertakes resistance training to **counteract** this effect.

And I heard the most **awful** rumor about a certain lord with a taste of fresh **cadaver**.  
**Strictly speaking**, such a thing would not be **in accordance with** the King's laws.  
   
Everyone's well **aware** of your **enduring fondness** for Lord Start's wife.  
I saw you **escorting** a certain foreign **dignitary**.

My friends were all so jealous that I got to meet the prime Minister  
One of the best parts about my job is that I get to work from home.  
My English is pretty good, but I'm still too shy to initiate conversations with strangers

Keep it up.  
   
   
The technology behind the **electrification** of the road linking Stockholm Arlanda airport to a **logistics** site outside the capital city aims to solve the **thorny** problems of keeping electric vehicles charged, and the manufacture of their batteries affordable.  
   
Of course, someone has to clean it up, just as our **deficit**.  
So, there you have it. A bit **rambling** and perhaps a bit **tangential**, but that's what Google means to me.  
I can **attest** that getting a job at Google didn't give me **a sense of** **validation** at all, in fact, I'm still a bit **sore** about being rejected by Dropbox. It's just human nature to never be satisfied with what we have.  
   
Social media sites are littered with seemingly **innocuous** little **quizzes**, games and surveys urging people to **reminisce** about specific topics, such as “What was your first job,” or “What was your first car?” The problem with participating in these informal surveys is that in doing so you may be **inadvertently** **giving away** the answers to “secret questions” that can be used to unlock access to a host of your online identities and accounts.  
I’m willing to bet that a good percentage of regular readers here would never respond — honestly or otherwise — to such questionnaires (except perhaps to **chide** others for responding  
But I thought it was worth mentioning because certain social networks — particularly Facebook — seem positively **overrun** with these **data-harvesting** **schemes**.  
   
An Apple R&D **Bonanza**  
After a brief **lull**, Apple's R&D expenditures are once again **exploding**.  
CAGR: Compound annual growth rate  
As seen in Exhibit 1, the **ramp** in Apple R&D expense **spanning** more than two decades has been **breathtaking**  
As seen in Exhibit 2, beginning in FY2Q17, Apple R&D expense growth has been **on an uptrend**  
The recent **ramp** in R&D expenditures suggests Apple is definitely **up to something**.  
This means that cash spent on developing new versions of existing products may not necessarily qualify as R&D. Instead, such expenses may have to be marked as a capital expenditure and **amortized** or depreciated over the life of the asset.  
Apple is also continuing to work on doubling down on hardware to control the brains powering its products.  
Some of these R&D **outposts** are a result of Apple acquiring teams of talent  
For a company that positions its ability to focus on a few things at any one time as a **core competency**, increased **experimentation** seems to be **at odds with** this value  
   
Since we are large there will be 2 **staggered** groups.

Even as a legal **sleight of hand**, the argument is quite a departure from Google’s **customary** efforts to present itself as a **disinterested** **arbiter** of information, a position that has become more **untenable** with time.  
Gareth Corfield, a reporter for The Register who covered the cases from the **courtroom**, said it’s **disingenuous** of Google to put on the **mantle** of journalism only when it suits them.  
   
Apple has made and caution about future decisions made in the name of “security” while potentially hiding questionable motives.
