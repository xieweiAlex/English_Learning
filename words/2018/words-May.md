  
I **similarly** use tags to mark points in the commit tree to **revisit** later (for example) - across branches. In fact, branches are just **recurrent** tags in fossil, so one less concept.  
  
What's the correct **procedure** of doing something.  
  
Code can be understood **tacitly**, it can be written, or it can be **embedded** in hardware.  
Cooked or raw, increased nutrient **intake** enabled us to evolve smaller teeth and chewing muscles and even a smaller **gut** than our ancestors or **primate** cousins. These evolutionary adaptations in turn supported the development of humans’ larger, **energy-hungry** brain.  
In the past 200 years, the complexity of code has increased by **orders of magnitude**.  
In this way, the **artisans**, **serfs**, and merchants who defined the medieval **agrarian** economy were replaced by an industrial economic order dominated by workers who executed the **subroutines** of complex algorithms performed by large corporate entities.  
Two broad categories of **epochal** change occurred as a result of this evolution of the economy from simplicity to complexity.  
One is that our capabilities grew, individually and **collectively**.  
I am **encoding** these **very words** while moving far above the clouds at a speed many times faster than the fastest **chariot**, employing a highly evolved **abacus** known as a computer.  
By consuming small **quantities** of a **serum** made from **mold** we can **defeat** **microscopic** “armies” that attack our bodies.  
Authority and autonomy, which for **millennia** we had kept unto ourselves and our immediate tribal groups as **uncodified** cultural **norms**.  
  
   
Detroit Was **Crumbling**. Here’s How It’s **Reviving**.  
You may not **slant** the container and n is at least 2.
