Give us beer before I **skin** you.  
I'll **shove** that stick up your **bunghole** and fuck you bloody.  
I can shave a spider's **arse** if I wanted to.  
And once it's **nicked**, there's no one around here who knows how to **unnick** it.  
You can die here at this **crossroads** a long way from home, or you can go back to your city and tell your Masters you didn't find what you were looking for.  
The northerners are such **fearsome** warriors.  
To find so lovely a **creature** working in your father's kitchens, it almost **beggars belief**.  
But **rest easy**, my load, I'm very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.  
Your **discretion** is legendary where your friends are concerned.  
I don't like **threats**. - Who **threatened** you?  
You have a **deft** hand with **diplomacy**.  
The **northerners** are a **superstitious** people.  
(**Superstition** is the belief in **supernatural causality**—that one event causes another without any natural process linking the two events—such as **astrology** and certain aspects linked to religion, like **omens**, **witchcraft** and **prophecies**, that contradict natural science.)  
We need more potatoes, get another **sack** from the **sledge**. Get the **turnips**, too.  
That was... **poorly handled**.  
We didn't have the kind of **rapport** that you and I have.  
**Take tonight off** to **mourn** Mhaegen's child.  
I don't listen to **filth**.  
I just wouldn't feel safe with you **lurking** about.  
I command you to arrest this **cutthroat**.  
If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd **fill your pants**.  
What does a **dyer**'s **apprentice** know about battles anyway?  
Gendry's an **armorer**'s apprentice.  
So you're a **highborn**, then. You're a lady.  
You should give me the **reins**. I'm a better rider than you.  
That **bauble** around your neck, did you pay the **iron price** for it or the gold?  
This is a **homecoming** I'll tell my grandchildren about.  
What's the world coming to when **smugglers** must **vouch** for the honor of kings.  
Come with me and **plunder** the greatest city in Westeros.  
You don't know how **persuasive** I am.  
You had no right to **exile** him.  
The other half will **plot** to **overthrow** you.  
This is what ruling is... Lying on a bed of weed, **ripping** them **out** by the root, one by one before they **strangle** you in your sleep.  
Mother gone, **for** the **sake** of you.  
My little brother has 100,000 men according to the **scouts**, men whose **allegiance** rightly belongs to me.  
She gives you nothing, no sons, only **stillborns**.  
   
He did so in a kind and **informative** way.  
It's no surprise that great companies often test and **disprove** ideas that sound good on paper.  
Thankfully, the letter that I wrote was friendly, not **cocky**. I would have looked foolish if I had acted as a **know-it-all**.  
"If we were to do that, it would be at the expense of this, and we think this is the better opportunity." That's the **gist** of what opportunity cost means.  
I've worked for companies where the leaders were **seduced** by any **smooth pitch** or shiny thing. **It never ended well**.  
The React community is very big on what I would call the ‘microlibrary architecture’, where applications are **composed** of a **myriad** **discrete**, single-purpose JavaScript libraries, in **homage** to the Unix philosophy.  
 The only **heuristic** a JavaScript developer can really use is popularity - number of downloads and Github stars - which **exacerbates** **faddishness**.  
I will **concede** that this is something of a cultural weakness of JavaScript developers.  
It starts innocently enough. You have a completely clean slate and want to keep things simple. You are a **devout** Agilist and **YAGNI** is your **watchword**.  
You miss the replies pointing out some critical **inadequacies** in X.js, because Medium **deliberately** suppresses them, and move on to finding a Y.  
   
   
On the first day of GDPR enforcement, Facebook and Google have been hit with a **raft** of lawsuits accusing the companies of **coercing** users into sharing personal data.  
Shrems told the Financial Times that the existing **consent** systems were clearly **noncompliant**. “They totally know that it’s going to be a violation,” he said. “They don’t even try to hide it.”  
Both companies have **disputed** the charges, arguing that existing measures were **adequate** to meet GDPR requirements.  
   
Trading over telegram makes it extremely easy and likely to get **scammed**, even when using an **escrow**.  
   
Trump **bemoans** 'young and beautiful lives destroyed by Russia **probe**'  
   
They don't name their children until they are two because of how high the **infant mortality** rate is.  
Across the **gorge** is the bridge of skulls which surprisingly connects both side of the wall.  
   
GOT II Episode 2  
---  
It was **well struck**, your grace.  
More **ravishing** than ever, big sister.  (The prince was **ravished** by Cinderella's beauty)  
You love your children, it's your one **redeeming** quality, that and your **cheekbones**.  
Disappeared? What, in a **puff** of smoke?  
Father will be **furious**.  
I'm afraid the **masons** today, are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.  
Joffrey killed my father, your **liege** lord.  
Heard a **stableboy** say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father.  
That's **foul**. - It's beyond **foul**.  
I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him, always treated me like **scum**.  
You got a nice wet **twat** between your legs?  
Let them come. My roots are **sunk** deep.  
I might just **gouge** his eye out.  
For the night is dark and full of **terror**.  
He is surrounded by fools and **fanatics**.  
You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of **fishwives**?  
Joffrey and the Queen **Regent** must **renounce** all claim to **dominion** of the North.  
We can **avenge** him together.  
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not **trustworthy**.  
If Renly sides with us, we'll **outnumber** them **two to one**.  
It needs a room to match it, not **vines** and flowers.  
   
   
San Francisco is a **vibrant** and **congested** city, and this **pilot** will demonstrate whether these common-sense regulations address our concerns around the **proliferation** of **motorized** scooters.  
   
A U.S. Government employee in China reported abnormal **sensations** of sound and pressure ahead of being diagnosed with a mild brain injury, in a case **reminiscent** of **diplomats** who fell ill in Cuba last year.

You **have yet to** see The Avengers? You're really missing out!  
   
   
It makes good sense for professionals to spend more time **upfront** learning more powerful tools because the savings over their career will be **massive**.  
Why do all articles about how wonderful vi is end with **condescension**.  
Because one way to get someone over the initial learning **hump** is to "encourage" them by challenging their **manhood**.  
Same principle behind a boot camp **sergeant** telling every single **incoming** group that they are the worst bunch of **nambypamby** **girliemen** he's ever seen and he's been in this army for 25 years.  
You're supposed to be motivated to try your best in the hope that he'll **begrudgingly** **concede** at the end that you didn't suck **after all**.  
It's a bit like a friend who has just spent half an hour talking you into going for that new wonderful job, and says 'or you could stay in your **crummy** current job'.  
Even your example is **riddled with** **condescension**, with your judgment from on high that your friend's job is "crummy". It's not only disrespectful; It betrays an **unsavory** **vanity** on your part.  
   
The Annual Fund is truly the financial **lifeblood** of the University.  
   
## Week 3  
GOT  
-----  
We went down into the **crypts** and my father was there.  
That beast is supposed to be chained in the **kennels**.  
Here, **shaggy** dog.  
Thank you for your **rendition**.  
I image it was even better received at that **tavern**.  
You **slip out** of that **gown** and we'll see if I'm up to it.  
I always thought you were a **stunted** fool.  
You will serve as Hand of the King **as my stead**.  
You will **bring** that boy King **to heel** and his mother too, if needed be.  
And if you get so much as a **whiff** of treason from any of the rest: xx, xx, xx  
I don't want you alone with this **sorceress**.  
It angered the **Great Shepherd**  
He's always been a **cunt**.  
It's hard for them to **simper** and bow without heads.  
When they **castrated** you, did they take the **pillar** with stones?  
I picture a **gash** like a woman's.  
Do you **lie awake** at night fearing my gash?  
A **grasper** from a minor house with a major talent for **befriending** powerful men ..and women.  
Watch yourself, **midget**.  
Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that **pyre**.  
Take off your **collars**. Go if you wish, no one will stop you.  
   
We recently **rolled out** support for protocol version 2 at Google and have seen a performance improvement of 3x for **no-op** fetches of a single branch on repositories containing 500k references.  
   
I can remember I got paired with an attractive **brunette** girl, short, 5′2, maybe 100 **lbs**, big **mousey** eyes, young, maybe 21 at most.  
   
The new way to make it in business is to spend big, grow fast and use **Kilimanjaro-size** piles of investor cash to **subsidize** your losses, with a plan to become profitable somewhere **down the road**.  
Silicon Valley wrote the **playbook** for spending money in pursuit of growth, and the tech industry remains a **hotbed** of fast-growing yet unprofitable companies.  
But it also reflects the **willingness** of shareholders and **deep-pocketed** private investors to keep fast-growing **upstarts** **afloat** long enough to conquer a potential “**winner-take-all**” market.  
Ultimately, companies like MoviePass **illustrate** the **perilous** **tightrope** many growing businesses must walk.  
Give too many **freebies** away, and you risk running out of cash before you’re big enough to **cash in**.  
   
Other devices like Nest Secure and Nest x Yale Locks behaved **erratically**.  
While not **catastrophic** (locks still worked, for example), it’s a reminder just how **precarious** life can be with internet-connected devices.  
   
YARN stands for **Yet Another Resource Negotiator**, but it's commonly referred to by the **acronym** alone; the full name was **self-deprecating** humor on the part of its developers.  
   
This is almost certainly not an **exhaustive** list.  
   
One thing that sets the Arbor doorbell apart is the **inclusion** of an integrated chime inside the bundled Wi-Fi **extender**. That makes Arbor suitable for a household or family as everyone can hear the doorbell ring, not just those who have the app installed and their phone nearby.

She always comes back with **scrapes** and **bruises**. She's so **clumsy**.  
**Bar** the doors.  
My role is to be **sly**, **obsequious** and without **scruples**.  
Can you free me from this **pit**?  
He's grandfather's **bannerman**, we can't expect his support?  
For 600 years they have never failed to **exact** their **toll**.  
Oh, **spare me**.  
Your mother would still be a **milkmaid** if I hadn't **squirted** you into her belly.  
Your family has always **pissed on** me.  
It's a man sword, it'll take a man to **wield** it.  
What does he want **in return**?  
You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal **squire**.  
I was helpless, **blind**, frail.  
They do seem rather **ferocious**.  
Surely there are ways to have me killed, that would be less **detrimental** to the war effort.  
Are you in **agony**, my lion?  
I happen to be a great judge of **character**.  
Try to **penetrate** the **enigma** that is me.  
I took her to the nearest **inn** and **fed** her.  
She was a **wheelwright**'s **orphan**.  
Together we finished off three chicken and a **flagon** of wine.  
If I die, **weep** for me.  
   
Pretty sure that's snarky parth.  
Does Python have a **ternary conditional** operator?  
   
However, when you get into the **nitty-gritty** of their usability and feature sets, there are a few **noteworthy** differences.  
LastPass passwords are stored on its remote servers, but they are **obfuscated** using 256-bit AES encryption.  
Passwords are only encrypted and decrypted on the local machine, so there should be no way a man in the middle attack could **compromise** your login **credentials**.  
1Password’s **Watchtower** feature is one that often **sets it apart from** the competition.  
   
Winner: **Draw**  
   
If you find that your access to any Zeplin projects is **wonky**, let me know.  
   
You cast a **spell** on me, spell on me  
   
   
The final answer should be in **lexicographic** order.  
   
**Stay tuned**  
Where's my **samurai**?  
   
Get out here, that **pole** is falling.  
**Durian**, **yuck** or **yum**?  
   
Juicy pieces of roasted chicken **thigh** are **bathed** in a **sumptuous** butter **tikka masala** sauce. Goes perfectly with **basmati rice** that soaks up all the sauce. Roasted **jalapeno**, garlic **chutney** and warm naan complete the meal. Contains **cashews**.  
   
Looks like someone used the hydra **schematics** print outs to soak up a **doggie** **mess** and left it there.  
Oops, you've made a **malformed** request.  
   
By having good **telemetry** and a good host monitoring solution for your machines you can collect the context necessary to answer these important questions.  
It can be hard to find mature tools that **proactively** detect security **incidents**.  
Kernel panics and obvious delays or other **lockups** are certainly not **acceptable**.

I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my **coronation**, I wish to be **crowned** within the **fortnight**.  
Today I shall accept **oaths** of **fealty** from my loyal **councilors**.  
To rule as **Regent** until the **heir** come of age.  
Your son has no **claim** to the **throne**.  
You **condemn** yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.  
Why is it no one ever trusts the **eunuch**?  
If that's true, then **slit** my throat and be done with it.  
Bring me a **horn** of **ale**, Snow.  
Lord Stark has been **charged** with **treason*.  
They say he **conspired** with Robert's brothers.  
When Lord Eddard began **plotting** to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.  
A child born of a **traitor**'s seed is no fit **consort** for our king.  
But if you're asking me to send men from the **Vale** to fight...  
That's why you so **valiantly** took up arms to defend my honor.  
I'm not your **toady** and I'm not your friend.  
You think you can win us over with your **trinkets**?  
The Lords of the Vale have always **spat upon** the hill tribes.  
Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and **sewn**, or it will **fester**.  
I'm the man you want leading the **vanguard**.  
Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his **manhood**.  
The rumors of your **demise** were **unfounded**.  
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so **meekly**.  
Jaime **smashed** the river lords at the Golden **Tooth**.  
Though the boy does have a certain **belligerence**.  
We shall require 3000 **helms** and shields plus **swords**, pikes.  
The wolf rushes into the lion's **jaws**.  
The **scouts** report Lord Tywin moves north.  
At the **Trident**, he didn't appear unitl the battle was done.

What's the correct **procedure** of doing something.  
   
Code can be understood **tacitly**, it can be written, or it can be **embedded** in hardware.  
Cooked or raw, increased nutrient **intake** enabled us to evolve smaller teeth and chewing muscles and even a smaller **gut** than our ancestors or **primate** cousins. These evolutionary adaptations in turn supported the development of humans’ larger, **energy-hungry** brain.  
In the past 200 years, the complexity of code has increased by **orders of magnitude**.  
In this way, the **artisans**, **serfs**, and merchants who defined the medieval **agrarian** economy were replaced by an industrial economic order dominated by workers who executed the **subroutines** of complex algorithms performed by large corporate entities.  
Two broad categories of **epochal** change occurred as a result of this evolution of the economy from simplicity to complexity.  
One is that our capabilities grew, individually and **collectively**.  
I am **encoding** these **very words** while moving far above the clouds at a speed many times faster than the fastest **chariot**, employing a highly evolved **abacus** known as a computer.  
By consuming small **quantities** of a **serum** made from **mold** we can **defeat** **microscopic** “armies” that attack our bodies.  
Authority and autonomy, which for **millennia** we had kept unto ourselves and our immediate tribal groups as **uncodified** cultural **norms**.
