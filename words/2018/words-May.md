   
He did so in a kind and **informative** way.  
It's no surprise that great companies often test and **disprove** ideas that sound good on paper.  
Thankfully, the letter that I wrote was friendly, not **cocky**. I would have looked foolish if I had acted as a **know-it-all**.  
"If we were to do that, it would be at the expense of this, and we think this is the better opportunity." That's the **gist** of what opportunity cost means.  
I've worked for companies where the leaders were **seduced** by any **smooth pitch** or shiny thing. **It never ended well**.  
The React community is very big on what I would call the ‘microlibrary architecture’, where applications are **composed** of a **myriad** **discrete**, single-purpose JavaScript libraries, in **homage** to the Unix philosophy.  
 The only **heuristic** a JavaScript developer can really use is popularity - number of downloads and Github stars - which **exacerbates** **faddishness**.  
I will **concede** that this is something of a cultural weakness of JavaScript developers.  
It starts innocently enough. You have a completely clean slate and want to keep things simple. You are a **devout** Agilist and **YAGNI** is your **watchword**.  
You miss the replies pointing out some critical **inadequacies** in X.js, because Medium **deliberately** suppresses them, and move on to finding a Y.  
   
On the first day of GDPR enforcement, Facebook and Google have been hit with a **raft** of lawsuits accusing the companies of **coercing** users into sharing personal data.  
Shrems told the Financial Times that the existing **consent** systems were clearly **noncompliant**. “They totally know that it’s going to be a violation,” he said. “They don’t even try to hide it.”  
Both companies have **disputed** the charges, arguing that existing measures were **adequate** to meet GDPR requirements.

You **have yet to** see The Avengers? You're really missing out!  
   
   
It makes good sense for professionals to spend more time **upfront** learning more powerful tools because the savings over their career will be **massive**.  
Why do all articles about how wonderful vi is end with **condescension**.  
Because one way to get someone over the initial learning **hump** is to "encourage" them by challenging their **manhood**.  
Same principle behind a boot camp **sergeant** telling every single **incoming** group that they are the worst bunch of **nambypamby** **girliemen** he's ever seen and he's been in this army for 25 years.  
You're supposed to be motivated to try your best in the hope that he'll **begrudgingly** **concede** at the end that you didn't suck **after all**.  
It's a bit like a friend who has just spent half an hour talking you into going for that new wonderful job, and says 'or you could stay in your **crummy** current job'.  
Even your example is **riddled with** **condescension**, with your judgment from on high that your friend's job is "crummy". It's not only disrespectful; It betrays an **unsavory** **vanity** on your part.

We recently **rolled out** support for protocol version 2 at Google and have seen a performance improvement of 3x for **no-op** fetches of a single branch on repositories containing 500k references.  
   
I can remember I got paired with an attractive **brunette** girl, short, 5′2, maybe 100 **lbs**, big **mousey** eyes, young, maybe 21 at most.  
   
The new way to make it in business is to spend big, grow fast and use **Kilimanjaro-size** piles of investor cash to **subsidize** your losses, with a plan to become profitable somewhere **down the road**.  - 
Silicon Valley wrote the **playbook** for spending money in pursuit of growth, and the tech industry remains a **hotbed** of fast-growing yet unprofitable companies.  
But it also reflects the **willingness** of shareholders and **deep-pocketed** private investors to keep fast-growing **upstarts** **afloat** long enough to conquer a potential “**winner-take-all**” market.  
Ultimately, companies like MoviePass **illustrate** the **perilous** **tightrope** many growing businesses must walk.  
Give too many **freebies** away, and you risk running out of cash before you’re big enough to **cash in**.  
   
Other devices like Nest Secure and Nest x Yale Locks behaved **erratically**. -   
While not **catastrophic** (locks still worked, for example), it’s a reminder just how **precarious** life can be with internet-connected devices.  
   
YARN stands for **Yet Another Resource Negotiator**, but it's commonly referred to by the **acronym** alone; the full name was **self-deprecating** humor on the part of its developers.  
   
This is almost certainly not an **exhaustive** list.  
   
One thing that sets the Arbor doorbell apart is the **inclusion** of an integrated chime inside the bundled Wi-Fi **extender**. That makes Arbor suitable for a household or family as everyone can hear the doorbell ring, not just those who have the app installed and their phone nearby.

However, when you get into the **nitty-gritty** of their usability and feature sets, there are a few **noteworthy** differences. -   
LastPass passwords are stored on its remote servers, but they are **obfuscated** using 256-bit AES encryption.  
Passwords are only encrypted and decrypted on the local machine, so there should be no way a man in the middle attack could **compromise** your login **credentials**.  
1Password’s **Watchtower** feature is one that often **sets it apart from** the competition.

Looks like someone used the hydra **schematics** print outs to soak up a **doggie** **mess** and left it there.  
Oops, you've made a **malformed** request.

I **similarly** use tags to mark points in the commit tree to **revisit** later (for example) - across branches. In fact, branches are just **recurrent** tags in fossil, so one less concept.  
   
What's the correct **procedure** of doing something.  
   
Code can be understood **tacitly**, it can be written, or it can be **embedded** in hardware.  
Cooked or raw, increased nutrient **intake** enabled us to evolve smaller teeth and chewing muscles and even a smaller **gut** than our ancestors or **primate** cousins. These evolutionary adaptations in turn supported the development of humans’ larger, **energy-hungry** brain.  
In the past 200 years, the complexity of code has increased by **orders of magnitude**.  
In this way, the **artisans**, **serfs**, and merchants who defined the medieval **agrarian** economy were replaced by an industrial economic order dominated by workers who executed the **subroutines** of complex algorithms performed by large corporate entities.  
Two broad categories of **epochal** change occurred as a result of this evolution of the economy from simplicity to complexity.  
One is that our capabilities grew, individually and **collectively**.  
I am **encoding** these **very words** while moving far above the clouds at a speed many times faster than the fastest **chariot**, employing a highly evolved **abacus** known as a computer.
