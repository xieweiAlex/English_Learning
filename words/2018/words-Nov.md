(the **burglar** was spotted by **vigilant** neighbours.)

Tell the **parallels** of Rome and U.S.

(a **moratorium** on the testing of **atomic bombs**)  
**Sleep Apnea** Patients (**transient** **cessation** of **respiration**)  
  
  
I do believe this filtering system is **rather good**  
There must be a specific **vacancy** defined, such as «Java developer» or «Senior system analyst».

Google and Amazon can do this sort of crap because thousands of young **hotshot** programmers-to-be who graduated from the Ivy Leagues apply to them.  
  
  
**retribution** is at hand  
A **wicked** and **unscrupulous** politician  
**Wicked** children are quite **annoying**

**civil liberty**  
  
  
It’s a **sheer** **overhanging** cliff

But you'll **get the hang of** it.  
Some of the problems which she is expected to solve are pretty simple problems, but I just can't seem to **get the hang of** any of them on my own  
  
their graduates would often need a lot of **grooming** before they could really be independently and reliably productive in the commercial words of application development or software engineering  
Inventing new algorithms with **theoretical significance** is not your job  
You were too **obtuse** to take the hint  
As a self-taught programmer who doesn't have a CS degree, my experience has been that this is not a significant **hurdle** to any workplace that I would seriously consider applying  
(the seemingly **inexorable** march of new technology)  
In the past decade, there has been an **inexorable** adoption of open source in most aspects of computing  
**proprietary software** vendors  
When you compare the market cap and revenue of Red Hat to Microsoft or Amazon or Oracle, even Red Hat starts to look like a **lukewarm** success  
The overwhelming success of Linux is **disproportionate** to the performance of Red Hat. Great for open source, a little disappointing for Red Hat  
To **make matters worse**, the more successful an open source project, the more large companies want to **co-opt** the code base  
()  
I’s a **veritable** shit-show  
the chances of going public and creating a large standalone company are pretty **darn** **slim**

**Incite** a crowd to riot  
The **burglar** was caught, but his **confederate** got away.  
The current crisis and its political **fallout**

He **squanders** all the money which his father gives him.  
The **spectre** of economic crisis is constantly **haunting** some countries  
**porridge** oats **enriched** with extra **oat bran**  
  
The other defining feature of companies that have started in this **era** has been **eschewing** the practice of hiring non-software engineer roles  
They want you to consider all the **repercussions**  
(heard the **repercussions** of the shot)  
At the same time, hyper-growth means traffic growth and the **resultant** technical scaling issues, as well as greater **repercussions** for both complete failure and minor user experience issues  
Finally, we arrive at the idea of “**fungibility**,” which is the **crux** of the failure of the pure DevOps model when organizations scale beyond a certain number of engineers  
Operations engineers and software engineers are partners, not **interchangeable** **cogs**  
acting as a **liaison** between product teams and infrastructure teams  
Modern hyper-growth Internet companies have (in my opinion) an **egregiously** large amount of **burnout**, primarily due to the **grueling** product demands coupled with a lack of investment in operational infrastructure  
(an **egregious** lie, an **egregious** mistake )  
I believe it is possible for engineering leadership to **buck the trend** by getting ahead of operations before it becomes a major **impediment** to organizational stability.  
(an **impediment** to reform, he has an **impediment** in speech)  
  
  
People with heart or lung disease should remain indoors and avoid heavy **exertion**.

a **precarious** assumption  
The **complicity** between the army and drug smugglers  
Parrots **imitate** human speech.  
After the election, the **coalition** fragmented  
Some sort of **placebo effect**, I guess  
**annuity bonds**  
Java comes with a **plethora** of ready-made types  
I prefer to think of myself as **quirky**  
the **frail** of Russian economy  
She looks **frail** and **vulnerable**  
  
  
This makes the world’s second-largest economy an internet-enabled **paradise**, **albeit** with an important **caveat**  
the program of government censorship that keeps anything even **vaguely** **subversive** offline  
(**subversive** literature)  
**granular control**  
Google’s prototype also required users to submit identifying information, including phone numbers, which could allow Chinese intelligence agencies to **root out** **dissidents**.  
The revelations about Dragonfly **reverberated** widely, and the company’s efforts to **quiet** the **furor** only **prolonged* it.  
You don’t make the world’s information universally accessible and useful by **kowtowing** to dictators.  
He and Brian argued that Dragonfly was being **overplayed** by the media. It was merely “**exploratory**,” Pichai said  
**on the premise** that they were somehow exceptions to the **corporate norm**  
They have immense and, in some ways, **unprecedented** power. And the **checks** on this power are currently **scarce**  
**Scarcity**  
after Edward Snowden revealed that the National Security Agency had **intercepted** Google data, Downey **railed** against the program as an example of government **overreach**  
In his new memo, Downey **contrasted** the **altruistic** ambitions of Google’s founders with what he presented as a company now motivated by a desire for growth and profit  
  
or even give **alms** to a **panhandler**—they often wear QR codes **slung** around their necks. It’s possible to spend **long stretches** in China without so much as touching a **banknote**  
  
It's time to **rouse** the children.  
**catholicism**  
a **subdued** plaid shirt, There is a **subdued** atmosphere in the school at exam time  
The country was **subdued** by the enemy  
a vibrant **cosmopolitan** city  
The hotel was run by a **trio** of brothers.  
She was **subjected** to a **torrent** of abuse  
A **hand-grenade** is a **missile** weapon.  
An actor's **foray** into politics  
the **garrison** made a **foray** against Richard's camp  
**anoint** & baptism ?  
  
  
But it pretty much **obliterated** the whole "I love you" thing.  
(The town was **obliterated** by the bombs.)  
  
We don’t care if they’re doing something that isn’t interesting to us. We don’t care if we’re **lapping** them  
  
The **moderator** invoked a rule causing the debate to be ended.  
I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is **indispensable**  
  
**quantum computing**  
  
That's a good **throw back**  
I'm not **picking on** this woman  
because he is **likable**.  
**cavalierly**

It was me **brain fart** this morning.  
  
We're being cut like **leeks**.  
  
In celebration of the best US Holiday, we will be throwing an August Home Thanksgiving **Potluck**  
  
  
Few policymakers in Washington or London believed that the Soviets would be able to resist the Nazi **onslaught** for more than six weeks
