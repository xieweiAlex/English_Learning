   
Throughout this tutorial, we've worked with **readymade** docker images.  
(**Prefabrication**)  
My goal with this tutorial was to **whet** your appetite and show you the power of Docker  
so if that's your deal, feel free to **holler** there  
   
I’m a little surprised by how many people tell me they have no hobbies. It may seem a small thing, but — at the risk of sounding **grandiose** — I see it as a sign of a civilization **in decline**.  
   
As far as office confessions go, that might seem pretty **tepid**.  
The post proved unusually **divisive**, and comments **flooded in**.  
Reactions split between those who felt Etherable was cheating, or at least **deceiving**, the employer, and those who thought the coder had simply found a clever way to perform the job at hand. Etherable never responded to the **ensuing** discussion. Perhaps **spooked** by the attention  
At a moment when the **specter** of mass automation **haunts** workers, **rogue** programmers demonstrate how the threat can become a **godsend** when taken into coders’ hands, with or without their employers’ knowledge  
The promise of automation, **touted** by optimistic economists and sanguine futurists, has been that yielding work to machines would eliminate the **drudgery** of mindless, repetitive labor, freeing humans to fill our days with leisure, creative pursuits, or more dynamic work.  
Auto-automation had erased menial toil, reduced his stress, and let him pursue his actual interests.  
Two weeks before he left, he handed his boss a diskette loaded with the program and documentation on how it ran.  
Yet many self-automators are afraid of sharing their code outside the cubicle.  
Even if a program **impeccably** performs their job, many feel that automation for one’s own benefit is wrong.  
And most employment **contracts** **stipulate** that intellectual property developed on company time belongs to the employer.  
Jordan says he and his colleagues keep a **tight lid** on their automation techniques, to maintain control over how they’re used: “We generally keep these tools to ourselves.”  
   
After that I would mostly just browse forums and do absolutely **jack shit** at work.  
(Do you know **jack shit**? )  
   
Just few lines of configuration and we have two Docker containers running successfully **in unison**.  
   
These are the **nuts and bolts** of hundreds of important projects.  
Additionally, many popular email clients have **bastardized** email to the point where the only way to use git+email for many people starts with abandoning the email client they’re used to using.

In the next (and final) part of the tutorial, we'll up the ante a bit and deploy an application that mimics the real-world more closely; an app with a pbrsistent back-end storage tier.  
The idea of bundling a process with its dependencies in a sandbox (called containers) is what makes this so powerful.  
We want our application to also generate our minified Javascript file for production.

From an operations standpoint, **apart from** portability containers also give more **granular control** over resources giving your infrastructure improved efficiency which can result in better utilization of your compute resources.  
This tutorial aims to be the **one-stop shop** for getting your hands dirty with Docker.  
Apart from demystifying the Docker **landscape**, it'll give you **hands-on** experience with building and deploying your own webapps on the Cloud.  
Getting all the tooling setup on your computer can be a **daunting** task.  
**Thus** running Docker now is a **cakewalk**.

(she asked me a lot of very **pertinent** questions)  
(**pertinent** data)  
   
Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have the high **overhead** and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources  
But this isolation comes at great cost — the computational **overhead** spent virtualizing hardware for a guest OS to use is substantial  
(general overhead, overhead cost)  
   
**groupies**  
(The term groupie is derived from group, in reference to a musical group, but the word is also used in a more general sense, especially in casual conversation, to mean a particular kind of female fan **assumed** to be more interested in relationships with rockstars than in their music.)

Why do some liberals **vehemently** **loathe** Trump?  
In the political sense, I therefore define “liberals” as people who are inclusive: **desirous** of eliminating barriers to equal **participation**, very much in favor of **multiculturalism**, and largely agnostic (meaning they don’t mix faith and politics)  
Trump is disliked by many more groups than just liberals and for different reasons: from being an **amoral** **womanizer** to a business fraud  
Some liberals see him as **publicity hound**, always looking for the **limelight** and frequently on **tabloid** news or shock radio describing his latest sexual conquest.  
Trump is not just **immoral**, he’s **amoral**.  
He’s an **egotistical** bully.  
(**Egotism** is the drive to maintain and enhance favorable views of oneself, and generally features an **inflated** opinion of one's personal features and importance. It often includes intellectual, physical, social and other **overestimations**.)

The **snarky** might say a DevOps engineer is a “server guy” with delusions of **grandeur**, someone who’s **rebranded** himself/herself but mostly just automates deployments  
By bridging traditional **silos** with automation and collaboration, the organization can work cooperatively to construct, test, and release updates rapidly and reliably.  
You’ll be constantly learning new technologies and skills that can be applied elsewhere, so DevOps will keep you from getting **pigeonholed** into one path.  
You then need to get to know your way around their work, hopefully contribute to it, and inevitably respond to their **crises** quickly.  
DevOps calls for communication skills and empathy — moving beyond the **parochial** viewpoint and attitudes of your own original role, being open to alternate points of view, and working to integrate different mindsets.  
Generally, the goal is to solve those issues, **tear down** those **silo walls**, and develop a shared sense of responsibility for the health of the end product.  
   
Many companies are adopting DevOps as a mainstream strategical tool and therefore there are **ample** of job opportunities for DevOps engineers.
