Why do some liberals **vehemently** **loathe** Trump?
In the political sense, I therefore define “liberals” as people who are inclusive: **desirous** of eliminating barriers to equal **participation**, very much in favor of **multiculturalism**, and largely agnostic (meaning they don’t mix faith and politics)
Trump is disliked by many more groups than just liberals and for different reasons: from being an **amoral** **womanizer** to a business fraud
Some liberals see him as **publicity hound**, always looking for the **limelight** and frequently on **tabloid** news or shock radio describing his latest sexual conquest. 
Trump is not just **immoral**, he’s **amoral**.  
He’s an **egotistical** bully.  
(**Egotism** is the drive to maintain and enhance favorable views of oneself, and generally features an **inflated** opinion of one's personal features and importance. It often includes intellectual, physical, social and other **overestimations**.)

The Liberal approach would be some kind of **blanket amnesty** and probably no restrictions on hiring because, oh those poor dears who are **fleeing oppression** or just wanna better job.

The **snarky** might say a DevOps engineer is a “server guy” with delusions of **grandeur**, someone who’s **rebranded** himself/herself but mostly just automates deployments
By bridging traditional **silos** with automation and collaboration, the organization can work cooperatively to construct, test, and release updates rapidly and reliably.  
You’ll be constantly learning new technologies and skills that can be applied elsewhere, so DevOps will keep you from getting **pigeonholed** into one path.  
You then need to get to know your way around their work, hopefully contribute to it, and inevitably respond to their **crises** quickly.  
DevOps calls for communication skills and empathy — moving beyond the **parochial** viewpoint and attitudes of your own original role, being open to alternate points of view, and working to integrate different mindsets.  
Generally, the goal is to solve those issues, **tear down** those **silo walls**, and develop a shared sense of responsibility for the health of the end product.  

Many companies are adopting DevOps as a mainstream strategical tool and therefore there are **ample** of job opportunities for DevOps engineers.

Sure, there are some **innate** abilities that may give certain programmers an advantage **over** their peers. And others may struggle to **grasp** the basics. But, the barrier for most engineers looking to go from good to great is not **genetics** or luck.
In order to become a “rockstar” engineer (**cringe**), one must not only be smart and capable. You have to want it. You have to be willing to dedicate a whole **heap of time** and energy into becoming masterful.

Gerson Dias shares his thoughts. “Knowledge and experience come with time, and **raw talent is nothing without passion**,” he says.
