The paper by John Griffin, a **finance** professor at the University of Texas, and Amin Shams, a graduate student, is likely to **stoke** a debate about how much of Bitcoin’s **skyrocketing** gain last year was caused by the **covert** actions of a few big players, rather than real demand from investors.  
  
Mr. Griffin looked at the flow of digital tokens **going in and out** of Bitfinex and identified several distinct patterns that suggest that someone or some people at the exchange successfully worked to **push up** prices when they **sagged** at other exchanges.  
Tether **issuances** cannot be used to **prop up** the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex.  
This method is not **conclusive**, but it has helped government authorities and academics spot suspicious activity in the past.  
It is great to see academic work trying to **causally** assess if market manipulation is **taking place**.  
In a small gathering of academics at Harvard University this spring, he even **floated** the possibility of creating a new virtual currency, the “**deplorables** coin.”  
  
  
This paper investigates whether Tether, a digital currency **pegged** to U.S. dollars, influences Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices during the recent boom. Using algorithms to analyze the blockchain data, we find that purchases with Tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices. Less than 1% of hours with such heavy Tether transactions are associated with 50% of the meteoric rise in Bitcoin and 64% of other top **cryptocurrencies**. The flow clusters below round prices, induces **asymmetric** **auto-correlations** in Bitcoin, and suggests incomplete Tether backing before month-ends. These patterns cannot be explained by investor demand proxies but are most consistent with the supply-based hypothesis where Tether is used to provide price support and manipulate cryptocurrency prices.  
  
I think that the cat is already **out of the bag**, and releasing details of this security problem **makes sense**.  
Since this has gone public, is there a reason to keep this under **embargo**.  
  
But when asked about that problem, a Facebook spokesperson told me the company is looking into adding a **preemptive** snooze option in the next few weeks, potentially in News Feed Preferences.  
   
  
So many healthy, tasty things to try. Sesame brown rice comes with purple sweet potatoes, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and marinated cabbage and kale. Miso-marinated chicken, roasted broccolini, and pickled cucumber complete the bowl. Topped with sesame soy ginger dressing. Served chilled!  
   
   
Since you didn't sleep much, you are gonna run out of **adrenaline** for most of the day.  
Bitcoin’s Price Was Artificially **Inflated**, **Fueling** **Skyrocketing** Value, Researchers Say.  
In my work as an **Integrations Engineer** at Librato, I find myself **dabbling** in many of our codebase. In the last few months.  
But when said colleagues found out that I was planning to write a guide for how to make a happy Vim setup for working with Java, they **rebuffed** me.  
(Her rebuff thoroughly deflated him)
I was reluctant at first – IDEs feel like big, **hulking**, slow programs.  
   
Fifteen percent concentrated **power of will**  
   
**IIRC**: If I remember correctly.  
Jeff said today that it's not **cast in stone**.  
I think my constant **nagging** eventually convinced her to switch.  
   
   
On the **off-chance** that the server hands us a Yale OTA, ignore it...for now

The history of Rome and **Macedon** is a **tangled** one; to explain it in depth goes beyond the **remit** of this article  
   
Even be worried that we're up to something **nefarious** (good for you for being **paranoid**!).  
   
The thief has found himself a new place for his **thievery** again.  
I find it very strange that President Trump has such a hard time getting along with the leaders of the world's major democracies but feels very comfortable with **despots** and **authoritarian** leaders like Putin, Xi Jinping, Duterte and Mohammad Bin Salman.  
   
They are all **lemmings**.

Richard, the name has to be something **primal** something that you can **scream out** during **intercourse**.  
   
Nope, he is a **cautionary tale**.  
An **off-duty** FBI agent was **impressing** a crowd at a downtown Denver **distillery** and bar with dance moves and an **improvised** **back flip** - until his handgun **tumbled out** of his **waistband holster** and a round **went off** as he picked it up. Injuring another **clubgoer**.
