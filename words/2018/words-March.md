Big tech platforms — Amazon, Facebook, Google — control a large and growing share of our **commerce** and communications, and the scope and degree of their **dominance** poses real **hazards**.  
A bipartisan consensus has formed around this idea. Senator Elizabeth Warren has charged tech giants with using their **heft** to “**snuff out** competition.”
