we got a **compass bearing**
**What makes you think** I have interest in helping you. 
are we still **on course**? 
I'm **sensing** a lack of confidence 
compass provided by the **carvings on a stick**. 
that's right, **avalanche** 
you **bastards** **put up** your best player. 
**crouching tiger and hidden dragon** get something good 
**lay it on** me. 
**you are on**.  
let the **slaughter** begin 
because we are **outsiders** here 
my **chef** just quit 
My unit was **decommissioned**. 
I was **dismissed** from my life in the military 
being alone like a **lighthouse keeper** 
a **purge** they called it. 
and the **hostiles** allowed you to stay here? 
**be my guest** :) 
so **pardon** it's **bitterness**
there is an **underwater beacon** 
they **emit** **sonar pings** 
**slurping** 
Yes, I was an **interrogator** 
That she **recognised** it from a **mere glimpse** 
not every **nook and cranny**, john 
**thud**, I would never touch a woman 
the whole place is **wired**. 
So I would **stare out** of the window into the **alley**. 
I would hear him **howl** from three stories above 
and he **purrs** 
a strange **inhabitant**. 
an **aperitif** of mysterious island fruit. 
and you and i go for a little **stroll** 
you are not on the list because you are **flawed**. 
**because you are angry, weak and frightened**
you are not as **omniscient** 
I was following a **boar**. 
just a **coincidence**, isn't it. 
what are these **pylons**? 
A **security perimeter**. 
I **stayed over**, I sang to you. 
goodbye **kiddo**. it's great to see you again.
please don't **give up on** us. 
**we are here**. 

he just want to **snuggle**. 
Just a **Walrus** doing **hardcore abs workout** with his human..

**squeaking caterpillar** 

**deadline**
**expire**

how do you greet people when you **bump into** someone you know in you city? 

I have **participated** in many interviews, many **debriefs**, and i have been interviewed many times myself

I made a small **incision** in his body 
he is **very much looking** forward to meeting you. 
and you **couldn't wait until** tomrrow morning? 
why don't we see if we can come up with some kind of peaceful **resolution**? 
I was **flattered** you reached me out. 
**Mind** if I ask you something? 
it's a human **womb**, obviously. 
don't **bother** ... 
I didn't want to tell you until I'm sure. 
It worked. 
because you are **insufferable** and you are **mean**. 
The **walkie** -- hold it up to me. 
	-- what about the **surgery**. 
take your time, there is no rush 
you want to do a **biopsy** to see if it is **malignant** 

the interviewer always very **cunning** 

And as you know, much of **carnage** was due to the bursting of a real estate bubble — **fueled by** **subprime** loans.

if you **stop by** New Jersey 
I had my first **asthma** in China. 
By the end of the day all I could do was focus on pushing air in and out of my **lungs**. 

Gave me medicine for a cold I didn't have, an EKG for a lung issue? They sucked every fen and every mao from me they could. 
I told them to give me inhaler and let me go. 
the slid me the bill. 
I squinted at the paper, trying to lesson the blow. 

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

This bald eagle just **swooped in**. A beautiful symbol of our freedom. Happy Independence Day from Alaska!

**meh** 

He’s a fake president, **utterly** **unfit** in every way for the position and an embarrassment to the country

If Donald Trump were a real president, he’d behave with a **dignity** and seriousness becoming the office. He wouldn’t waste his time writing **puerile** tweets, **insulting** his critics, making baseless **accusations**, lying left and right, **waging** war against the “mainstream” news media and generally making a fool of himself.

**Spotted** in SF yesterday
I **spotted** him in the crowd.

**plurals** 

Calm down your **tilt**. 

Asian Fetish

we can see that the result depends on the **divisibility** of a number by 9

An **asterisk** indicates that the field is required.

Time is most precious **asset** to everyone. 

you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

The amount of knowledge and cultural exchange is **unparalleled**.

I have personally **changed way too much** and I cannot agree with many **societal norms** that exist in India

** Everybody has their own lives and outlooks**.
it just **happens to** be legal

and they rely on big donors, for the most part to fill their **election coffers** 

he is anything but a Japan **basher**
Japan could simply not afford to be held back by **"feudalistic"** China and Korea
The principal cause of **animosity** is Japan’s **invasion** of China in the 1930s and 1940s
the **resentment** between the two countries goes back further still, to Japan’s intellectual break with China, when it threw itself into a **headlong effort** to modernize and **Europeanize**
China was once considered the **fount** of all knowledge for Japan, an isolated **archipelago** of islands sitting like an **apostrophic** afterthought off the eastern edge of the vast **Eurasian landmass**. **Kyoto**, founded in the 8th century and Japan’s imperial capital for a thousand years, was a **replica** of the **Tang Dynasty** capital Chang’an. Serious Japanese poets wrote in Chinese. Only women used the **phonetic** kana script — a lady-in-waiting at the imperial court composed the 11th-century Tale of Genji, considered the world’s first novel. For men, to be learned meant to be learned in Chinese. 

For Japan to break with China was a **traumatic** decision.

the written script, concepts of **Confucian hierarchy** and **filial piety**
**Opium War** of 1839-1842
We better start **repositioning** ourselves

I would like to work in a environment there is **not much hierarchy**, like flat organization. 

Dalai Lama was on top of the **caste system** of Tibet and led a **theocratic form of government**.

The people can finally get **running water**, electricity and **secular education**

It is fucking **spectacular**, isn’t it?!!!
he would **detonate** it to kill his enemies easily?
