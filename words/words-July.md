To **spare** me the **pretense** that you're actually offended.  
You find you have a **full-blown** **insurrection** on your hands.  
Let me out here, give me some **semblance** of freedom.  
If they still want me, **they would've** **stormed** this **camp** long ago.  
This is the man whose boat parked **offshore**.  
who's the man in the **blindfold**.  
static **hissing**.  
I'm trying to render it **inert**.

Only two years ago were people complaining about Facebook being 100MB. Now it‚Äôs a **whopping** 354MB!  
  
Why people don't like it? -- Why wouldn't people like it?

**Do you know who I am**?  
And I'm going to **renew** my **overrulling** of your **objection**.

I was hurt pretty badly, in fact, **if it weren't for her**, I **would have never made it** to the shore.  
This is my **trial**.  
I want you to help me **bust him out**.  
Wanna play some **backgammon**? - you're on.  
Just **give me you word** you are not gonna do anything to her. - **You have my word**.  
What? the **boathouse** down by the dock?  
If Hugo knows, everybody knows.  
You've arranged this meeting so you could **blackmail** me?  
It's **extortion**. - **Protection racket**  
Can that be **amended**?  
You're a **fugitive**,  
I'm responsible for the **well-being** of this island.  
This court is now in **recess**.  
My key witness said she got **cold feet**.

I just want this **to be over**.  
10 years **probation** and you **stay put**.

And because we‚Äôre **inundated** with resumes from people who want to work for us, he sees no reason to change.  
These new CEOs would also act as a brake to **temper** the founder‚Äôs **excesses**  
Yet technology cycles have become a **treadmill**, and to survive startups need to be on a continuous innovation cycle  
and in the last five years over 200 other Unicorns have **emerged**, and most still have their founders at the **helm**.  
they stayed just long enough to **pump up** their resumes and left for much better paying jobs  
And because fewer senior engineers considered it a great place to work, the company‚Äôs initial technology advantage has started to **erode**.

**gagging** and coughing.  
Julet is a **mole**.  
**Three days from now**, ther's gonna be a **raid** on the beach.

being alone like a **lighthouse keeper**  
a **purge** they called it.  
and the **hostiles** allowed you to stay here?

I made a small **incision** in his body  
he is **very much looking** forward to meeting you.  
and you **couldn't wait until** tomrrow morning?  
why don't we see if we can come up with some kind of peaceful **resolution**?

He‚Äôs a fake president, **utterly** **unfit** in every way for the position and an embarrassment to the country  
  
If Donald Trump were a real president, he‚Äôd behave with a **dignity** and seriousness becoming the office.

he is anything but a Japan **basher**  
Japan could simply not afford to be held back by **"feudalistic"** China and Korea  
The principal cause of **animosity** is Japan‚Äôs **invasion** of China in the 1930s and 1940s  
the **resentment** between the two countries goes back further still, to Japan‚Äôs intellectual break with China, when it threw itself into a **headlong effort** to modernize and **Europeanize**  
China was once considered the **fount** of all knowledge for Japan, an isolated **archipelago** of islands sitting like an **apostrophic** afterthought off the eastern edge of the vast **Eurasian landmass**. **Kyoto**, founded in the 8th century and Japan‚Äôs imperial capital for a thousand years, was a **replica** of the **Tang Dynasty** capital Chang‚Äôan. Serious Japanese poets wrote in Chinese. Only women used the **phonetic** kana script ‚Äî a lady-in-waiting at the imperial court composed the 11th-century Tale of Genji, considered the world‚Äôs first novel. For men, to be learned meant to be learned in Chinese.
