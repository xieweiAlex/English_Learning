There is no lake in this image, just **tilt** your head. 

**Grid** 325. Motion sensor alarm was **tripped**. 
You do realize those dudes get **wiped out**, right? 
I mean, I saw the **pit** where all the bodies got **dumped**. 
**Step up**, take your **jumpsuit** and **work assignment**. 
They are our new **inductees**. 
Stop **staring**. 
That boat I came here on, it was filled with **commandos**. 
Based on your **aptitude** test, you'll be doing **janitorial** work. 
Even during the **blitz**. 
I brought you a **sandwich**, I didn't put **mustard** on it. 
**It's been a pleasure working with you**, sayid. 
I'd say it was **retribution** for the work you and I have been doing.  
I'll have the **rib eye**, bloody. 
You think I'm a **prostitute**? 
I'm **between jobs** **at the moment**. 
Then how do you know so much about **temptation**. 
I would really like to say it's **unanimous**. 
You so much as **flinch**, and you're dead. 
I was hired to bring you to the **guam**. 
You're a **bounty hunter**? 

Python’s growth is **spread** pretty **evenly** across **industries**

Maybe I had heard about it, but **dismissed** the idea because I didn’t work in a lab
A **tenured** professor has an appointment that lasts until retirement age, except for **dismissal** with **just cause**.
They saw **right through** my **self-esteem** issues, and made me a bit more confident that I wasn’t entirely **delusional** about my aspirations.
Maybe a funny story is that this all happened because of a **grant** I applied for. 
Next to improving my writing and getting me invitations to give talks, blogging has given me a bigger **sense of purpose**
I have a **love-hate relationship** with blogging
And I made a website about the **Spice Girls**.

**Penchant** for Unit Testing/UI Testing

Women **Parliamentarians** of Iran in front of the gate of the Iranian **Parliament** , mid 1970s.

Note: I just spoke at Coldfront 2017 about why I’m such a big **proponent** of the Web
"Betting" sounds a bit **haphazard**, **it’s more calculated than that**. It would probably be better described as "**investing**."
Investing what? Our **time and attention**.
You could argue, that at least to some degree, Flash died because of its "**closed-ness**".
Regardless, one thing is clear from a **risk mitigation** perspective: open is better than closed

But the scientists involved say these are "**knee-jerk**" reactions.  

You and your friends are surprisingly **genetically** similar, according to a study appearing in PNAS
The similarity isn't **immense** -- about 1%, roughly the same as between fourth **cousins** -- but it's **significant enough** to be detectedand to have **evolutionary implications**.
Looking across the whole **genome**," said Fowler, "we find that, on average, we are **genetically** similar to our friends
After all, if you're **succumbing** to an unpleasant bug, it would be great to have friends who are resistant to it and could help **nurse** you back to health
It seems that our fitness depends not only on our own **genetic** constitutions, but also on the genetic constitutions of our friends.

Everything about this is soft and **dreamy**, like a **perfumed** envelope.  
  
Good luck and **Godspeed**.  
I know you, Sayid. And **deep down** in your heart, you know we **should've** never left the island.  
**Don't you care** about them?  
It just didn't **work out**.  
She died of a **brain aneurysm**.  
Thanks anyway, **Plato**.  
The baby is **breech**.  
It's upside down. She needs a **caesarean**.  
It's **creole**, I **improvised**.  
**Is that so**? that's so.  
Sawyer **perpetrates** a lie to protect the remaining survivors.  
We lost power, "stall"  
  
**Pulp Fiction**  
  
At the risk of sounding like a **contrarian**, I did not love this film.  
The **cinematography** here at least, is **masterful**. Director Christopher Nolan has, **without a doubt**, reached the **pinnacle** of on-screen **spectacle** here.  
The **feats** of practical effects in this film are **breathtaking**  
as a film it lacks emotional **firepower** due to the absence of a strongly written **protagonist**.  
This is **strangely** **uncharacteristic** of a director of Nolan's **caliber**  
**Superb performances** from an **ensemble cast**?  
But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection **severely** **detracts from** the **awe-inspiring** scope and technical **prowess** displayed.  
  
The fantastically directed film is told from 3 perspectives non **chronologically**.  
Given the **outright** **gushing** of critics in praising this film  
There was no **grand scale**  
That is a **heinous** **omission** and **oversight** and ultimately fails to tell the story of Dunkirk as it should be told  
A few soldiers standing around on the beach looks incredibly silly when the characters say on more than one **occasion** that there are over 300,000 men there. Where are they? We never saw them. **Ludicrous**.  
This does not come close to **approximating** the **flotilla** of ships, boats and other **watercraft** used  
Yet at the conclusion, as the men are **disembarking**, back safe in England, we are supposed to be **swept up** in a **swelling** feeling of appreciation for something that we never actually **witness**. Very **bizarre**.  
As for the **climax**, the scene of a **Spitfire** seemingly free of the laws of physics and gravity is **bereft** of all logic, and was such an **eye-rolling** **piece of nonsense**,  
Not only am I not doing that now, I **won't even bother** watching this once it's on **cable** or Netflix.  
A technical masterpiece that is nearly **devoid** of **palpable emotion** and compelling characters.  
  
**Thieving** bastard.  
  
He walked downstairs, noticing 	how his **limp** penis pressed against the front of his underwear, his **nubile** balls **dangling** hairily below.  
  
**sewing kit**.  
  
You're my **downfall**, you're my **muse**  
  
The **workaday world** of a modern programmer **abounds** with Unix tools, **stitched** together in **myriad ways**.  
Good tools have a **seemingly** limitless application, constrained only by your own imagination  
  
**Acne vulgaris** (or simply acne) is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair **follicles** become **clogged** with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. Acne is characterized by areas of blackheads, whiteheads, **pimples**, and **greasy skin**, and may result in **scarring**. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.
