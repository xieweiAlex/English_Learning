Everything about this is soft and **dreamy**, like a **perfumed** envelope.  
  
Good luck and **Godspeed**.  
I know you, Sayid. And **deep down** in your heart, you know we **should've** never left the island.  
**Don't you care** about them?  
It just didn't **work out**.  
She died of a **brain aneurysm**.  
Thanks anyway, **Plato**.  
The baby is **breech**.  
It's upside down. She needs a **caesarean**.  
It's **creole**, I **improvised**.  
**Is that so**? that's so.  
Sawyer **perpetrates** a lie to protect the remaining survivors.  
We lost power, "stall"  
  
**Pulp Fiction**  
  
At the risk of sounding like a **contrarian**, I did not love this film.  
The **cinematography** here at least, is **masterful**. Director Christopher Nolan has, without a doubt, reached the **pinnacle** of on-screen **spectacle** here.  
The **feats** of practical effects in this film are **breathtaking**  
as a film it lacks emotional **firepower** due to the absence of a strongly written **protagonist**.  
This is **strangely** **uncharacteristic** of a director of Nolan's **caliber**  
**Superb performances** from an **ensemble cast**?  
But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection **severely** **detracts from** the **awe-inspiring** scope and technical **prowess** displayed.  
  
The fantastically directed film is told from 3 perspectives non **chronologically**.  
Given the **outright** **gushing** of critics in praising this film  
There was no **grand scale**  
That is a **heinous** **omission** and **oversight** and ultimately fails to tell the story of Dunkirk as it should be told  
A few soldiers standing around on the beach looks incredibly silly when the characters say on more than one occasion that there are over 300,000 men there. Where are they? We never saw them. **Ludicrous**.  
This does not come close to approximating the **flotilla** of ships, boats and other **watercraft** used  
Yet at the conclusion, as the men are **disembarking**, back safe in England, we are supposed to be **swept up** in a **swelling** feeling of appreciation for something that we never actually witness. Very **bizarre**.  
As for the climax, the scene of a **Spitfire** seemingly free of the laws of physics and gravity is **bereft** of all logic, and was such an **eye-rolling** **piece of nonsense**,  
Not only am I not doing that now, I **won't even bother** watching this once it's on **cable** or Netflix.  
A technical masterpiece that is nearly **devoid** of **palpable emotion** and compelling characters.  
  
**Thieving** bastard.  
  
He walked downstairs, noticing 	how his **limp** penis pressed against the front of his underwear, his **nubile** balls **dangling** hairily below.  
  
**sewing kit**.  
  
You're my **downfall**, you're my **muse**  
  
The **workaday world** of a modern programmer **abounds** with Unix tools, **stitched** together in **myriad ways**.  
Good tools have a **seemingly** limitless application, constrained only by your own imagination  
  
**Acne vulgaris** (or simply acne) is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair **follicles** become **clogged** with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. Acne is characterized by areas of blackheads, whiteheads, **pimples**, and **greasy skin**, and may result in **scarring**. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.
