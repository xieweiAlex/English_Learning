@Schwarzenegger discusses how gerrymandering affects Congress -- and a potential solution

Hello Hugo, you **got a minute**?  
I went on a **walkabout**.  
because its original name has been used as a **derogatory** term in Australian culture, **demeaning** its spiritual significance.  
Not exactly, but it was pretty **intense**.  
We spent 10 days in the **outback**.  
You're not **pulling my leg**, are you?  
Well, looks **peachy**.  
I need, uh, something sharp - a **razor**.  
He was weak and **pathetic** and **irreparably** broken. But beside that, there was something **admirable** about him.  
So why the **bracelets**?  
  
I'm **impressed**.  
a government on the island of Taiwan established in 1949 by Chiang Kai-shek after the **conquest** of mainland China  
  
As of 2016, Crashlytics has been installed on over 2.5 billion active devices (**virtually** all active mobile devices) and is the #1 most installed SDK for performance  
  
  
Hey, **kiddo**. Girl's in recovery.  
He gets **marched** straight up here **as if** he was moses.  
If your app is not yet installed, they are **prompted** to download it.  
  
There's a reason why Steve Jobs Theater and the overall Apple Park campus is **reminiscent** of Disney World.  
However, after I attended Apple’s **inaugural** event at Steve Jobs Theater, Apple’s motivation behind the building became **crystal** clear.  
although Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive and other Apple designers played a **pivotal** role.  
Most visitors arriving at Steve Jobs Theater for the first time will be **impressed** by its **seclusion** and **allure**.  
Apple's prior two iPhone launches took place in a venue that fit 50% more people,  
Despite the building's large **footprint**, the exhibit space felt incredibly **cramped**.  
  
Not every Wall Street bank chief is **bearish** on bitcoin.  
  
Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman takes a more measured view on the **cryptocurrency** than **crosstown** rival Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase & Co. head who earlier this month called it “a fraud” that’s in a speculative bubble worse than tulip bulbs.  
Bitcoin is “certainly something more than just a **fad**,”  
  
**Flamethrower** vs liquid **nitrogen**  
  
please **detach** the part that says, “intentionally blank” on the front card.

National **anthem**.  
  
you're **busted**.  
“We’re still in a start-up **funk**,” said Robert Litan, an economist and **antitrust** lawyer who has studied the issue. “Obviously the recession had a lot to do with it, but then you’re left with the **conundrum**: Why hasn’t there been any recovery?”  
Mr. Trump **framed** the conflicts as a test of the international system. The **bombastic** **flourishes** that generate approving **roars** at political events were met by **stony silence**, interrupted a few times by a **smattering** of applause.  
  
President Trump, in declaring Tuesday that **sovereignty** should be the guiding principle of affairs between nations, sketched out a **radically** different vision of the world order than his **forebears**.  
yet saying almost nothing about Russia, which **seized** territory from its neighbor Ukraine, and **meddled** in the American presidential election.  
It was a **defiant** speech, **peppered** with threats and **denunciations**. Some critics predicted that the very countries Mr. Trump **condemned** would someday fling his words back at him.  
He repeatedly **extolled** “sovereignty” in a setting where the **term** traditionally has been **brandished** by nations like Russia, China.  
Mr. Trump framed the conflicts as a test of the international system. The **bombastic** **flourishes** that generate approving roars at political events were met by **stony silence**, interrupted a few times by a smattering of applause.  
Without mentioning it by name, Mr. Trump also **chastised** China for continuing to deal with its **rogue** neighbor.  
the **rhetorical** **retaliation** from **Pyongyang** was inevitable  
That Mr. Kim would call Mr. Trump a “mentally **deranged** U.S. **dotard**” on Friday was something more of a surprise.  
  
So just bring it out to Dr. Chang, and we'll all **call it a day**. Okay?  
Did you just. You konw, it **stinks**.  
Dude, that guy is totally a **douche**.  
This island has a number of deceased individuals residing on it.  
He is the man who chartered the boat you'll be getting on next week.  
Toss him.  
I can make time.  
I just have an errant to run, I'll be right back.  
Welcome to the meeting, twitchy.  
I will meet you in the motor pool.  
Afraid I'll stage a coup?  
all right, let's get started.  
Mind if I join you? - Please.  
one of these days, sooner or later, I'm going to find a loophole, my friend.  
Ben told me that he strangled you.  
That's my recollection, Yes.  
All right, here's your sedatives.  
you wanna stay here and whine about it.  
Unlock the damn cuffs.  
  
  
  
  
We still don’t know what the full ramifications will be.  
Many consumers have scrambled to try to protect themselves  
Months before the hack itself, Equifax could easily have patched the hole in its system that hackers exploited, but it simply didn’t.  
These private institutions hoover up our data, often without our knowledge and consent, and then sell it off to banks, landlords and even prospective employers.  
because none of us can refuse to be a part of this system and opt out if we don’t like how we’re being treated.  
The United States government is, of course, not impervious to data breaches, nor does it have a perfect track record of fending them off.

As soon as it got dark outside a small group of people according to police started vandalizing property and causing trouble.  
  
and his friend, Gates, a **sophomore** at Harvard  
Over the years, the PC has transformed from a hobbyist’s toy to an **indispensable** tool that continues to change the world  
**Hobbyists** are **ecstatic**, despite the fact that, even with BASIC, there is little you can actually do with the Altair  
But after months of **salvos** (VimGolf **one-upmanship**, **gratuitous** references to this Stack Overflow question) no clear victor has **emerged**.  
So last week, I set out to see what the Triplebyte data has to say on the issue. Take this with a **grain of salt** (**correlation** does not imply **causation**)  
Today, a **plurality** of engineers are choosing to interview in Python  
Hiring decisions should be made using a clear **scoring** system, not **gut feelings**  
Humans are good at gathering information, but bad at ignoring **bias**  
We **unconsciously** **pattern match**  
   
**What for**?  
Things are starting to **spin** **out of control** here.  
All right, **I got it**.  
What the hell are you doing, **tubby**?  
You're **maniac** **Iraqi** buddy shot linus.  
He's going inito **Hypoxia** shock.  
At least do me the **courtesy** of telling me why.  
Like someone hit me with an **oar**, but I'll live.  
You order was to **exterminate** that woman.  
**After you**.  
   
XXXX congratulations you can be a **jackass** in four different languages now  
   
Seattle is a cleaner city with a lot of natural beauty. Even in the urban center, you are surrounded by mountains, water, and **lush** vegetation that creates a relaxing atmosphere  
There are a lot of tech companies in Seattle but the community lacks the **edgy** **vitality** and **churn** of the Bay Area.  
The tech scene is less **frenetic**.  
Seattle's restaurants have excellent execution and diversity but they tend to have a slightly more casual ambiance.  
San Francisco has a more extroverted culture  
San Francisco has a more international, cosmopolitan, high-fashion feel to it, a bit like Manhattan  
Most people will assume San Francisco wins hands down here given Seattle's reputation as a rainy and gloomy outpost.  
It is hard to make friends here compared to the bay area where so many people are transplants.  
They do not want to mingle with you  
   
I skate to where the **puck** is going to be, not where it has been.  
   
**infrared** camera.  
There is no lake in this image, just **tilt** your head.  
   
**Grid** 325. Motion sensor alarm was **tripped**.  
You do realize those dudes get **wiped out**, right?  
I mean, I saw the **pit** where all the bodies got **dumped**.  
**Step up**, take your **jumpsuit** and **work assignment**.  
They are our new **inductees**.  
Stop **staring**.  
That boat I came here on, it was filled with **commandos**.  
Based on your **aptitude** test, you'll be doing **janitorial** work.  
Even during the **blitz**.  
I brought you a **sandwich**, I didn't put **mustard** on it.  
**It's been a pleasure working with you**, sayid.  
I'd say it was **retribution** for the work you and I have been doing.  
I'll have the **rib eye**, bloody.  
You think I'm a **prostitute**?  
I'm **between jobs** **at the moment**.  
Then how do you know so much about **temptation**.  
I would really like to say it's **unanimous**.  
You so much as **flinch**, and you're dead.  
I was hired to bring you to the **guam**.  
You're a **bounty hunter**?  
   
Python’s growth is **spread** pretty **evenly** across **industries**  
   
Maybe I had heard about it, but **dismissed** the idea because I didn’t work in a lab  
A **tenured** professor has an appointment that lasts until retirement age, except for **dismissal** with **just cause**.  
They saw **right through** my **self-esteem** issues, and made me a bit more confident that I wasn’t entirely **delusional** about my aspirations.  
Maybe a funny story is that this all happened because of a **grant** I applied for.  
Next to improving my writing and getting me invitations to give talks, blogging has given me a bigger **sense of purpose**  
I have a **love-hate relationship** with blogging  
And I made a website about the **Spice Girls**.

Note: I just spoke at Coldfront 2017 about why I’m such a big **proponent** of the Web  
"Betting" sounds a bit **haphazard**, **it’s more calculated than that**. It would probably be better described as "**investing**."  
Investing what? Our **time and attention**.  
You could argue, that at least to some degree, Flash died because of its "**closed-ness**".  
Regardless, one thing is clear from a **risk mitigation** perspective: open is better than closed  
   
But the scientists involved say these are "**knee-jerk**" reactions.  
   
You and your friends are surprisingly **genetically** similar, according to a study appearing in PNAS  
The similarity isn't **immense** -- about 1%, roughly the same as between fourth **cousins** -- but it's **significant enough** to be detectedand to have **evolutionary implications**.  
Looking across the whole **genome**," said Fowler, "we find that, on average, we are **genetically** similar to our friends  
After all, if you're **succumbing** to an unpleasant bug, it would be great to have friends who are resistant to it and could help **nurse** you back to health  
It seems that our fitness depends not only on our own **genetic** constitutions, but also on the genetic constitutions of our friends.  
   
Everything about this is soft and **dreamy**, like a **perfumed** envelope.  
   
Good luck and **Godspeed**.  
I know you, Sayid. And **deep down** in your heart, you know we **should've** never left the island.  
**Don't you care** about them?  
It just didn't **work out**.  
She died of a **brain aneurysm**.  
Thanks anyway, **Plato**.  
The baby is **breech**.  
It's upside down. She needs a **caesarean**.  
It's **creole**, I **improvised**.  
**Is that so**? that's so.  
Sawyer **perpetrates** a lie to protect the remaining survivors.  
We lost power, "stall"  
   
**Pulp Fiction**  
   
At the risk of sounding like a **contrarian**, I did not love this film.  
The **cinematography** here at least, is **masterful**. Director Christopher Nolan has, **without a doubt**, reached the **pinnacle** of on-screen **spectacle** here.  
The **feats** of practical effects in this film are **breathtaking**  
as a film it lacks emotional **firepower** due to the absence of a strongly written **protagonist**.  
This is **strangely** **uncharacteristic** of a director of Nolan's **caliber**  
**Superb performances** from an **ensemble cast**?  
But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection **severely** **detracts from** the **awe-inspiring** scope and technical **prowess** displayed.  
   
The fantastically directed film is told from 3 perspectives non **chronologically**.  
Given the **outright** **gushing** of critics in praising this film  
There was no **grand scale**  
That is a **heinous** **omission** and **oversight** and ultimately fails to tell the story of Dunkirk as it should be told  
A few soldiers standing around on the beach looks incredibly silly when the characters say on more than one **occasion** that there are over 300,000 men there. Where are they? We never saw them. **Ludicrous**.  
This does not come close to **approximating** the **flotilla** of ships, boats and other **watercraft** used  
Yet at the conclusion, as the men are **disembarking**, back safe in England, we are supposed to be **swept up** in a **swelling** feeling of appreciation for something that we never actually **witness**. Very **bizarre**.  
As for the **climax**, the scene of a **Spitfire** seemingly free of the laws of physics and gravity is **bereft** of all logic, and was such an **eye-rolling** **piece of nonsense**,  
Not only am I not doing that now, I **won't even bother** watching this once it's on **cable** or Netflix.  
A technical masterpiece that is nearly **devoid** of **palpable emotion** and compelling characters.  
   
**Thieving** bastard.  
   
He walked downstairs, noticing 	how his **limp** penis pressed against the front of his underwear, his **nubile** balls **dangling** hairily below.

You're my **downfall**, you're my **muse**  
   
The **workaday world** of a modern programmer **abounds** with Unix tools, **stitched** together in **myriad ways**.  
Good tools have a **seemingly** limitless application, constrained only by your own imagination  
   
**Acne vulgaris** (or simply acne) is a long-term skin disease that occurs when hair **follicles** become **clogged** with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. Acne is characterized by areas of blackheads, whiteheads, **pimples**, and **greasy skin**, and may result in **scarring**. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.
