## Week 1

wringer  

Vim and Emacs are always there for you, cozy, calm and **willing**  
It’s the kind of **dismissal** you can only do when there’s nobody you respect on “**the other side**”.  
I could tell you all of the reasons I prefer Vim, and such observations are **eye-rollingly** **trite**. Modal editing! Composibility! Keyboard macros! -  
Unlike the original authors, I don’t have a **contempt** for other tools  
When I first came here, I had a **crummy** apartment. -   
Holman **thumped** the desk with his hand.  
You could see a same facial feature, on one person it's a **knockout**, for on another, it does nothing for you.  
Beauty is The **Eye of the Beholder**.  

A **boxy** jacket  
She was **radiant** with health.   

I **have a thing** for you.  
I'm **green**.  
The 2008 financial crisis, which **cleaved** the market in half.
I will be **better off** without you.  
Nubile, young **temptress** **traipsing** around your house. -  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has warned it causes burnout, and incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that with WFH, “You just don’t **riff** the same way,” which hurts innovation. -  
The book **delineates** rational and non-rational motivations/triggers associated with each type of thinking process, and how they complement each other  
Good advice comes from people who have **indisputable** expertise.
A good mentor will do this with some care, and even some **trepidation**.  
this whole father thing scares the heck **outta** me.   
If he **veers** into advice, just listen respectfully and come back to the request  
**kindred purpose**  
By the way, that exercise in class went pretty well, and then we decided to **jettison** it anyway and keep the prior version of the exercise because it was more effective. -  

Being or doing? The real inner me, or the busy, successful outer me? Which is it? Life design thinks that’s a false **dichotomy**  
This isn’t just our own **rehash** of positive thinking; it’s a design tool that’s imperative to life design.  
After four or five losses, they would **wince** every time Reed announced, “I’m going to run again!”  
When his cancer treatment was over and his cancer was in **remission**, Reed had no idea what to do next.  
It beats the hell out of being **despondently** confused about why bad things happen. -  
He made some **overtures** into the industry, looking for work.  
He stayed in touch with the NFL executives and spent hundreds of hours building innovative sports analysis models, which he would show them **every now and then**.  

To meet Reed today is to meet what appears in every way to be a very successful and **content** young man  
He’s happily married, with a beautiful baby girl and an **irrepressibly** **delightful** three-year-old son  
which means you accept them and don’t **second-guess** yourself  
First you gather and create some options, then you **narrow down** your list to your top alternatives, then you finally choose, and then, last but not least, you...agonize over that choice.  
Now, once you've got a **hefty** list of options, chances are that you’re struggling with all the possibilities.  
One week, the researchers set up a table in the store showing off six different specialty jams (with **snazzy** flavors like kiwi- orange, strawberry-lavender...you get the idea).  

You didn't know that you had a preference until an unwanted decision occurred as a **fait accompli**. -  
It turns out that the part of the brain that is working to help us make our best choices is in the **basal** **ganglia** -  
She didn't know why it was her left knee, but over years of **attentive** practice she came to trust what her knee had to tell her  
to be sure you make space so your emotional and intuitive ways of knowing can **surface** in the process.  
It turns out that **reversibility** is not **conducive** to establishing reliable happiness with a decision  
Keep your **reframed** understanding of decision making **handy**, and be sure to win the internal argument with yourself when you’re tempted to rehash and **ruminate**.  

Though it was **out of vogue** among his friends to consider getting involved in government and the public sector -  
It’s more of an inaction than an action, and your brain just hates that, the same way nature **abhors** a vacuum -  
Andy was a star **pupil**.  
**churn**, 
**wring** 
**manipulate**  

but they can also **let go**, be in-the-moment, and improvise, coming up with ideas that are truly original  
Typically, if you are the **facilitator** who brings the group together, you might have already framed the brainstorming topic  

This is perhaps the most important part of a brainstorm, and the one activity that we notice most groups **leave out**  
Using the Internet as your only job-finding method is **nothing short of** **masochistic**  
This role is not for the **faint of heart**, and only those with a proven and successful track record should apply.  
If you have those specific skills, great; add them to your résumé, **word for word**. If you don’t, list very specific skills that are similar.  
In our experience, if more than eight people have been through the **wringer** and no decisions have been made, the hiring process is probably broken.  
post the “**phantom**” job description, wait the required two weeks, do a few **cursory** interviews, and then hire the person they wanted all along.  
Networking is just **hustling** people—it’s **slimy**. -  
This isn’t favoritism—it’s just **communal** behavior -  
a lot of people have an instant **aversion** to the term “networking.” -  
Nature of the work. Salary and the friendliness of co-workers come in second and third, to complete this completely dysfunctional job-seeker **trifecta**. -  
You can’t know it from a **faulty** job description

To some degree, it’s also a **numbers game**—the more connections you make, the more prototypes you run, the more opportunities will turn into offers.
Designers get **juiced** by what they call **wicked problems**  
I am **out of shape**, and I’m frequently **winded** if I have to run for the train  
They will help you know if you’re **on course** or **off course**  
sketching in his idea log, or chopping an onion with his favorite knife to be moments most **conducive** to flow  

“It’s heartbreaking… it’s been really **humiliating** and **degrading**  
He also announced that an effort to **redefine** human rights by his predecessor, Mike Pompeo, would be **disbanded**  
Blinken said the Biden administration would “**repudiate**” such "unbalanced statements.” -  

We can thank the Moon and some hearty **tugboats** for freeing the 1,300 foot vessel  
Various reports this morning indicate that Archegos Capital Management is the firm connected to the **fire sale**  
7.5% growth is still a **raging** **bonfire** of economic activity, which will hopefully translate to robust hiring and wage growth.  
Alex was too **jumpy**, too **neurotic**. -  
Nothing is more distracting than a **neurotic** boss.
