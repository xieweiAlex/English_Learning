**Acne vulgaris** (or simply acne) is a long-term skin disease that occurs when **hair follicles** become clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. Acne is characterized by areas of blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, and greasy skin, and may result in scarring. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.

But earlier this month came news of a potential game changer, from **no less** a tech **luminary** than Bill Joy.  
and a **visionary** who was working on the Internet of Things two decades ago.  
**alkaline accumulator**  
As Joy explains it, **Ionic**’s innovations combine the advantages of the familiar **alkaline** batteries we buy at the **drugstore** (cheap, safe, and reliable) with those of the more expensive, **fire-prone** **lithium** batteries in our computers and phones (powerful, rechargeable, and more earth-friendly).  
followed up on his famous WIRED **essay** about a future **techno-apocalypse**  
Yeah, that’s **fair**. I think this is a **black swan**  
Then you pour in a liquid so that the **ions** can move around.  
Films form, things go into [the] solution and run around and react with each other—you have safety issues like the battery catching fire.  
But in this battery, you have no liquid. You have just a **plastic**, a **polymer**, that replaces the liquid, so it’s solid.  
It also turns out that this **polymer** just happens to be **essentially** a **fire retardant** material  
They use **zinc** and **manganese dioxide**  
To power mobile devices like **camcorders**, [the industry] went to **lithium** chemistry  
But I don’t have a word for this new breakthrough, a solid that **conducts** ions at room temperature
