The press was accused of being **subservient** to the government.  
The S&P 500, they're the **Crème de la crème**.  

**catastrophize**.  
**postnasal**.  

**carpal tunnel syndrome**.  

I came away with the impression that Mehmet Oz was, despite his well-deserved medical **renown**, **preternaturally** **vapid** and **preening**, and, thus, to me, an incongruous figure. -  
And iPads are a huge business for Apple, and the iPad is now **solidly** established as a piece of our **cultural firmament**. Everyone knows what an iPad is. -

and if no one had, well, maybe could they **keep an eye out** for it.  
He wasn’t **forlorn**. He laughed even. That’s how he is. That’s how I am. That’s how we are. I’m his boy, as he still sometimes reminds me. But I know what that ring meant to him.

I hadn’t stopped feeling **heartsick** about his ring.  
It was no surprise I was **welling up** with tears come the morning.

The conduct of Cato was **applauded** by his **contemporaries** and has been admired by history.

> If you’re going to serve us a pile of dog shit on a plate, tell us it’s a **turd**. Don’t try to tell us it’s a sandwich.

**All in all**, Apple’s business was relatively flat. iPhone sales were up 6% but flat for the fiscal year;  

The family is a **microcosm** of society.  
The race turned into a **microcosm** of the presidential race. Allred claimed Cruz was a threat to democracy. And Cruz **likened** Allred to the top of the Democratic ticket.

We can **lament** our situation. We can analyze how we got here. We can try to learn lessons from what has happened. We have to do all these things.  
**Paradoxically**, however, Trump’s reckless **venality** is a reason for hope. Trump has the soul of a fascist but the mind of a **disordered child**.  
Trump’s victory is a **grim day** for the United States and for democracies around the world.  
You have every right to be **appalled**, **saddened**, shocked, and frightened.  
Soon, however, you should **dust yourself off**, square your shoulders, and take a deep breath. Americans who care about democracy have work to do.  
Trump winning in 2016 was like a **trapdoor** we didn’t even know existed opening suddenly under our feet.  
This is going to be bad. But we shouldn’t be **concussed** like we were in 2016.
