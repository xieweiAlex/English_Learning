"The UK's Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill must put an end to this false posturing, which is essentially a recreation of Apple's fees.  


Spotify has launched an outspoken attack on new transaction fees of up to 27% being levied by Apple in the US.  
On Wednesday, Apple announced it would permit app developers to sell products in places other than its own store - but only if they still paid commission.  
Spotify said that was "outrageous" and accused Apple of "stopping at nothing" to protect its profits.  
Spotify has reacted with **fury**, saying the policy "**flies in the face**" of the US court's attempt to enable greater competition.  
"Once again, Apple has demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to protect the profits they exact on the backs of developers and consumers under their app store monopoly," it said in a statement.

**Dissecting** business management, he brilliantly describes psychological impacts that can damage or benefit a firm.  

So, emphasizing what I sometimes **waggishly** call **remedial** worldly wisdom, I’m going to start by **waltzing** you through a few basic notions.  
I don’t think it’s necessary for most people to be terribly **facile** in statistics.  
The **notion** of a critical mass—that comes out of physics—is a very powerful model.  
It’s just been **dolled up** a little bit with fancy **lingo**.  
Then, when you get into psychology, of course, it gets very much more complicated. But it’s an **ungodly** important subject if you’re going to have any worldly wisdom.  

He also had a very interesting competitive strategy in the early days. He was like a prizefighter who wanted a great record so he could be in the finals and make a big TV hit. So what did he do? He went out and fought 42 palookas. Right? And the result was knockout, knockout, knockout—42 times.  
But it just wasn’t as lean and mean and shrewd and effective as Sam Walton. And, in due time, all Sears’s advantages of scale were not enough to prevent it from losing heavily to Walmart and other, similar retailers.  
He was thinking, “It’s a lousy business. We’re earning substandard returns and keeping it open just to be nice to the elderly workers. But we’re not going to put huge amounts of new capital into a lousy business.”  
However, Berkshire Hathaway, by and large, does not invest in these people who are surfing on complicated technology. After all, we’re cranky and idiosyncratic, as you may have noticed.

The model I like—to sort of simplify the notion of what goes on in a market for common stocks—is the pari-mutuel system122 at the racetrack.  

But it is given to human beings who work hard at it—who look and sift the world for a mispriced bet—that they can occasionally find one.  

They tried everything—moral suasion, threats, you name it.  
We didn’t have any clients who could fire us at Berkshire Hathaway. So we didn’t have to be governed by any such construct. And we came to this notion of finding a mispriced bet and loading up when we were very confident that we were right. So we’re way less diversified. And I think our system is miles better.

### Talk 1  

In a **vow** that students the world over may hope he **renounces**, Charlie delivered “the one and only graduation speech I will ever make” in 1986 at the Harvard School in Los Angeles.  

**The occasion** was the graduation of Philip Munger, the last of five Munger family sons to **matriculate** at this **prep school** (originally an all-boys institution and now the **coeducational** school called Harvard-Westlake).  

Despite Charlie’s **self-effacing** protestations.  
For those of you who want to remain unenlightened and **mirthless**, do not, under any circumstances, read this selection. -  

But whatever the topic, Charlie is **apt** to tell it like it is, which is exactly what he has done in over two decades of public speaking.  
Now that Headmaster Berrisford has selected one of the oldest and longest-serving trustees to make a **commencement speech**, **it behooves** the speaker to address two questions in every mind. -  

Benjamin Disraeli,78 as he rose to become one of the greatest prime ministers, learned to give up **vengeance** as a motivation for action, but he did retain some **outlet** for resentment by putting the names of people who wronged him on pieces of paper in a drawer.  

> Then, from time to time, he reviewed these names and took pleasure in noting the way the world had taken his enemies down without his assistance.  

once the richest king in the world. Later, in **ignominious** captivity, as he prepared to be burned alive, he said, “Well now do I remember the words of the historian Solon: ‘No man’s life should be accounted a happy one until it is over.’  (盖棺定论)  

My second prescription for misery is to learn everything you possibly can from your own experience, minimizing what you learn **vicariously** from the good and bad experiences of others, living and dead. This prescription is a sure-shot producer of misery and second-rate achievement.  
How little **originality** there is in the common disasters of mankind: drunk driving deaths, reckless driving **maimings**, **incurable** **venereal** diseases. -  
The other aspect of avoiding **vicarious wisdom** is the rule of not learning from the best work done before yours. -  
Because there is so much adversity out there, even for the lucky and wise, this will guarantee that, **in due course**, you will be permanently mired in misery.  
If my experience is any guide, the rustic’s approach is to be avoided at all cost by someone **bent on** misery.

## Week 2  

Charlie is content to swim **imperturbably** against the tide of popular opinion. -  
Most especially his appetite for hard work, but also his insatiable curiosity and patient **demeanor**.  
Charlie’s approach to investing is quite different from the more **rudimentary** systems used by most investors.  
The **unassailable** logic of Charlie’s ecosystem approach to investment analysis.  
Other times the factors employed combine to create enormous “**lollapalooza**-level” results, good or bad. -  
It is this **signature approach**, backed by Charlie’s formidable intellect, temperament, and decades of relevant experience, that have made him the virtuoso of business pattern recognition so valued by Buffett.  
His clarity is **hard-won**, the product of a lifetime of studying the patterns of human behavior, business systems, and a **myriad** of other scientific disciplines.  

> few investors share Charlie’s willingness to appear foolish by not following the herd.  

As we shall witness throughout the **remainder** of this book, the right kind of genetically **predetermined** wiring is needed as well.  
Charlie generally focuses first on what to avoid—that is, on what not to do—before he considers the **affirmative** steps he will take in a given situation.  
“All I want to know is where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there” is one of his favorite quips.  
**chessboard**.  

his carefully identified **circles of competence**.  

> To stay within these circles, he first applies a basic, overall screen, designed to limit his investment field to only “simple, understandable candidates.” As he says, “We have three baskets for investing: yes, no, and too tough to understand.”  

> It’s kind of fun to sit there and **outthink** people who are way smarter than you are because you’ve trained yourself to be more objective and more multidisciplinary. Furthermore, there is a lot of money in it, as I can testify from my own personal experience.  


**winnow**.  
Charlie **detests** placer mining, the process of sifting through piles of sand for specks of gold. -  
Charlie refers to a company’s competitive advantage as its moat: the virtual physical barrier it presents against **incursions**.  

> While poor outcomes are **excusable** in the Munger–Buffett world—given the fact that some outcomes are outside of their control—**sloppy** preparation and decision-making are never excusable because they are controllable.  

Such behavior implies uncertainty, and Charlie’s moves, few as they are, are **anything but uncertain**.  
When this theme is **extrapolated** into investment selection, the preferred Munger business emerges: some thrive by outcompeting (à la Selfish Gene) and others by out-cooperating (à la Darwin’s Blind Spot).  
Rather, each must be considered as part of the complex whole or **gestalt** of the investment analysis process, in much the same way that an individual tile is **integral to** the **larger mosaic** in which it appears. -  

Avoid big mistakes; **shun** permanent capital loss.  

> **Mimicking** the herd invites **regression to the mean**.  
Like his hero, Benjamin Franklin, Charlie Munger **painstakingly** developed and perfected unique approaches to personal and business endeavors.  

Do not just **spout** marketing **spiel** or you will quickly lose followers. -  
Let's **clear the air** so to speak.  
Quagmire just sort of **goes off on** Brian.  

Tim could barely **conceal** his disappointment. -  
Do Chinese Citizens **Conceal** Opposition to the CCP in Surveys?  

> A confession: most of my bogs are imaginary. The world doesn’t stick me there; I stick me there. These are, paradoxically, the most difficult bogs to escape, because it requires realizing that my perception of reality is not reality, and a lot of the mind is dedicated to preventing that exact thought.

He had told us often funny stories of people who either followed the group too blindly or **lashed out** too **reflexively**. “Crazy,” “**maladjusted**,” “pompous,” “self-satisfied”—we knew from his adjectives what he thought we should avoid.  

In both instances, he appears blunt and **avuncular**—that inimitable Charlie—but at the card table, he uses **a lack of indirection** for **harmless ribbing**, and at the dinner table, he uses indirection  
Even if he didn’t recognize himself in it, I figured he would enjoy the book’s Midwestern **milieu**, the immigrant striving of the Trillin family, and the humor. -  
He once said that he was **nonconformist** enough in his behavior and opinions that it made sense to chart a very straight course in **attire**.  
His going along with normal social customs and his sense of humor, he said, were what allowed his otherwise sometimes **prickly** temperament to harmonize with other people.  

**sartorial**  
As I walked home from the Bodleian Library each night, that nasty, **damp**, **penetrating** English cold would not get through.  

> It marks an **inflection point** in Bitcoin’s adoption. For the first time ever, millions of investors will now have access to Bitcoin in traditional brokerage accounts and large institutions like financial advisors, pension funds, and endowments will now be able to gain exposure to the asset.  


But trading volumes provide an incomplete picture because it doesn’t **delineate** between the dollar amount of inflows compared to outflows.  
Over the long term, these ETFs will likely improve liquidity in the asset because they **enlarge** the investor base and there will likely be increased trading volumes as institutions execute arbitrage trades when there is a price **discrepancy** between the ETF and the underlying bitcoin  

I don't want to **boast**, but I can actually speak six languages.

> Permeate means to spread or diffuse throughout, often referring to a liquid or gas passing through a solid substance.  
> Penetrate means to enter or pass through something, often with force or difficulty. It can also refer to understanding or making an impact on something.  


**tinder box**  
The rocks **underfoot** are still soft.  

Throughout the book, Charlie reveals his intellect, wit, values, and no end of rhetorical **flair**.  
Using **self-deprecation** and imagination to great effect, Charlie cheerfully compares himself to a counting horse, proposes “Glotz’s Sugared, Caffeinated Water” as a **marketing-bereft** label for Coca-Cola, and attests, “At least when I was young, I wasn't a total **klutz**." -  
**Inversion**.  
He **regales** his audience with humorous anecdotes and poignant tales rather than with a blizzard of facts and figures. He well knows, and wisely exploits, the traditional role of the storyteller as a **purveyor** of complex and detailed information. -  
**human foibles**.  
Charlie has purposefully **sidestepped** the **limelight**, choosing relative anonymity instead.  
Charlie’s formal education began at Dundee Elementary School, where he and his younger sisters, Mary and Carol, were **indoctrinated** with **ethical homilies**.  

Charlie’s teachers remember a smart kid who was also inclined to be a bit of a **wiseacre**. -  
Today, he can’t remember the first time he was exposed to the aphorisms of Ben Franklin, but they fueled an **ineffaceable** admiration for the eclectic and eccentric **statesman** and inventor. -  
By the time he was 14, the **precocious** learner had also become one of the doctor’s best friends.  
Even at an early age, Charlie showed a **sagacious** negotiating ability and usually gained a bigger **specimen** or one with unusual coloring.  
One of his sisters remembered years later that the family had to **endure** the **incessant** squeaking of hungry hamsters until Charlie arrived home from school to feed them.  
Kids played kick the can on warm summer evenings and went to Saturday **matinees** to see the latest **talkies**, such as **King Kong**, a favorite of 8-year-old Charlie.  
**hobos**.  

His lack of an undergraduate degree threatened to derail him, but a family friend, former Harvard Law School dean Roscoe Pound, **interceded** on Charlie’s behalf. -  

**Bell curve**, **top of the curve**.  
Charlie was just in a hurry, and the **customary pleasantries** of the classroom were of little concern to him.  

His **adored** son, Teddy, was **terminally** ill with **leukemia**.  
Charlie’s **affinity** for Benjamin Franklin’s expansive career in government, business, finance, and industry can be found in his many speeches and whenever he holds an audience, large or small.  

Charlie admires that trait in his mentor and strives to **emulate** Franklin.  


Can anything stop Trump the **sequel**? He’d like you to think his chances of **strutting** back into the White House. -  
Perhaps AI is a **busted flush**. Perhaps the revolution will just take time.

Never before had I heard a **venerated** businessperson express such **trenchant** insights about investing, finance, and the world more broadly, and with such—to use a favored Munger phrase—**chutzpah**.  
**numerical fluency**.  

> His essays **extol** the virtues of free enterprise, yes, but also of doing business the right way, with integrity and **rigor**. Of taking your work very seriously, but never yourself.  

Which started humbly when a teenage Charlie took a job in Warren’s grandfather’s grocery store and **culminated** in the one of the most successful investing relationships of all time.  
I am immensely grateful to Peter Kaufman for compiling this classic **tome**, and to Charlie Munger for his **irrefutable** wisdom and his gracious mentorship.  

Seek a partner who will never **second-guess** you nor **sulk** when you make expensive mistakes.  
All of the above is **splendid** advice. (I’ve never scored less than an A in self-graded exams.)

The US is **woefully** behind on high-speed rail.  
Harvard's **provost** Alan Garber will serve as interim president.  


It would have such a **salutary** effect.
