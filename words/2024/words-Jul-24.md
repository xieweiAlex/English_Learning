> “I love mechanism,” says Huberman; our feelings are integral to the apparatus. There are Huberman Husbands (men who optimize), a phenomenon not to be confused with #DaddyHuberman (used by women on TikTok in the man’s thrall).  


Today, Andrew Huberman is a **stiff**, **jacked** 48-year-old associate professor of neurology and **ophthalmology** at the Stanford University School of Medicine.  
**broad-minded** professor puppyishly **enamored** with the wonders of biological function.  
The **wayward** son would devote himself to therapy and also to science. -  
A **prophet** must constrain his **self-revelation**.  


His podcast is **revelatory** largely because it does not condescend, which has not been the way of public-health information in our time.  
He does not give the impression of someone **diluting** science to universally applicable **sound bites** for the **slobbering** masses.  
I do have to **choke back** a little bit here.

“He **in some ways** disappeared,” says David Spiegel, a Stanford psychiatrist who calls Andrew “**prodigiously smart**” and “intensely engaging.”

A spokesperson for Huberman denies **the account of** the **denigration** of women and the dead-baby story and says the hair story was **taken out of context**.  

He **puttered** around Huberman’s place, buying a juice, walking through the neighborhood, waiting for him to return.  
The relationship struck Sarah’s friends **as odd**.  
he actually enjoys the opportunity to **pull the rug out** from under you.  
“I’d like to emphasize that this podcast,” he would say every episode, with his particular combination of formality and discursiveness, “is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public.”  
he brought people back to their **corporeal** selves.  
Sarah began the first of several rounds of **IVF**.  
According to Sarah, Andrew’s rage intensified with **cohabitation**.  
Sarah was, in fact, changing. She felt herself getting smaller, constantly **appeasing**  
denies that he said being with her was like **bobbing for apples** **in feces**.  
The first three rounds of **IVF** did not produce healthy **embryos**.  
His **detractors** note that Huberman **extrapolates** wildly from limited animal studies, posits certainty where there is **ambiguity**, and stumbles when he **veers too far** from his narrow realm of study, but even they will tend to admit that the podcast is an **expansive**, free (or, as he puts it, “zero-cost”) **compendium** of human knowledge.  
**gathering dust**.  
It was in August 2022 that Sarah noticed she and Andrew could not go out without being **thronged** by people.

Each of the five was **assertive** and successful and educated and **sharp-witted**;  
**In the aggregate**, Andrew’s **therapeutic** language took on a **sinister** edge.  
says Wendy Zukerman in her bright **Aussie** accent, “a **wayward** childhood.  
It was a wealthy place, the kind of setting where the word **au pair** comes up frequently. -  
that seems like an example of somebody who has a, well, strong **aggressive drive** … and when disappointed, you know, **lashes back** or is passive.  

> There’s some way in which the person doesn’t feel good enough no matter what this person has achieved. So then there is a sense of the need and the right to overcontrol.

**chunksters**.  

**Cosmic**, **comic**, **cosmetic**.

> There is a hidden cost to everything you own. Things don’t just cost you monetarily. They cost you mentally, too.  

> The things we own, as the writer Chuck Palahniuk put in Fight Club, end up owning us. Because now we have to use it, we have to get our money’s worth out of that, we have to decide where to put it, how to take care of it, how to insure it. Some part of you is constantly carrying these and other subconscious mental burdens.

It can be the **wheel-barrow** that has a flat tire sitting out in the backyard.

The **outlying** villages were formally **annexed** by the town last year.  


Before Joe Biden’s **wretched** showing in last night’s presidential debate, the most **pressing question** about November’s election was whether Mr Biden could beat Donald Trump. Now it’s whether he should run at all. - **We think not**.
