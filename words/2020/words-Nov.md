The SEC Modernizes the **Accredited** Investor Definition  
A solution is a grand bargain, a **resounding** win, a comprehensive resolution expected to withstand the pressures of all unknown future challenges  
But Amazon is something else entirely, isn’t it? Its **amalgamation** of businesses don’t seem to make sense -  
It **defies** **norms** of focus yet it executes faster than seems possible for an entity of its size, **let alone** scope  
“a wide **assortment** of good quality merchandise” at “the lowest possible prices.”
not only did it provide zero value to the customer, it also **robbed** the customer of the opportunity to buy something that they did need  
The **advent** of the internet – of online shopping – meant that an online retailer had **infinite** shelf space  
Amazon would never be able to match Walmart’s **hard-won** skills in fighting on the customer’s behalf for better prices

The **canonical** example here is the DMV  
its customers cannot go elsewhere for service, and the DMV does not experience the pain of interacting with itself, and so the DMV will **perpetually** remain in **stasis** **at best**

Kvashuk reported the bitcoin **windfall** to the IRS but claimed the bitcoins had been a gift from his father

the great coder accepts that they are going to be REAAAALLY frustrated with their past **selves**  
(Eat up your fish and don’t be so **finicky**)
A great coder has learned that compiling is a **finicky** process especially if you are a member of a team  
A good coder might feel **flabbergasted** by such **occurrences** -  
The reason is that the great-coder/best-programmer has accepted and made peace with the **truism** that theory and reality do not always agree  
They do not **ruminate** on it because they know that quite often it is natural for a coder to find themselves in this position -  
I agree with it **in principle** but I doubt if it will happen in practice
Now the great coder is well aware that old code will contain bugs **precisely** because coders in the past did what is **depicted** above  
Which **more often than not** it will be of the abstract art type. The great coder **makes peace with** the “it is what it is” truism

As such, I will retreat into the **specious** cry of "**correlation** is not **causation**"  
I actually **abhor** this idea as it is broadly wrong except **at the margin**  
An example of the idea that **correlation** is not **causation** is the correlation between levels of cheese consumption and people who die **strangled** by their bedsheets  
It’s a **darkly** humorous example

If cloud-computing stocks **go wobbly** — and they will, because they already have been — it won't be because of the election or the economy
