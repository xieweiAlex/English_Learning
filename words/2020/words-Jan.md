The least **extrapolation** and the greatest avoidance of our own biases and preconceptions  
But for machines (as we know them) it should only take modest **velocities** (of the order of a few tens of kilometers a second) and an ability to **withstand** thousands or tens of thousands of years of travel

Every other aspect of Vim is **irredeemable**. The codebase is **atrocious**   
The plugin API is **cumbersome** and **restrictive**  
The dev community is **apathetic**  
The **benevolent** dictator is **averse to** change  
Yes, +python gives you access to Python’s libraries and syntax. But your code will be **littered** with calls to vim.eval() and vim.command()  
Indentation is **haphazard** -

I can now get a taste of the Vim community, defending a **mangled monster** of spaghetti code -  
here's certainly **a laundry list** of things I would like that have not been implemented, and not even a realistic timeline for them to be implemented  
Even the way this article was tweeted out by the author was **sophomoric** -
