They fear that a "**rip and replace**" method, which would rip Huawei technology from carriers that use the equipment and replace it with something else would be particularly harmful to rural areas  
**stubborn mystery**   
as did some of the FBI **bureaucrats** the president so **reviled**. -  
**state secret**  
First, there was the **inescapable** fact that, like Osama bin Laden, 15 of the 19 **hijackers** were Saudis  
**Qaida** terrorists  
they were minimally and **grudgingly** helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry.

For an **encore**, he sang an **unaccompanied** **folk song**. -  
Given the **lapse of time**, I don‚Äôt know any reason why the truth should be kept from the American people  

When I saw it, I was **livid**  
once I see it, I can not **unseen** it  
**deterministic**  

For example, it can trigger **manic episodes** in those with **bipolar disorder**   
and we're learning now, from researchers in Sweden and Germany, that insufficient sleep can even affect the **microbiota** in your gut.  
But does that apply to everyone? I‚Äôm a **petite** **couch potato**. Do I really need the same amount of water -  

## Week 3 
It's also quite a **light-hearted** and informal expression.

The technology was **substandard**  
The **scorching** sun is **parching** the grassland  

Where the 675 produces abundant low/**midrange** with practically zero **vibration**, with the 300 I have to stay in the **upper third** of the **tach** to maintain my pace.. and try to ignore the **vibes**. The Kawi doesn't mind being **flogged**, that's for sure

Some victims said they were intimidated and threatened with **excommunication**  
**gingerly** placed her underwear in a bucket of cold water before going back to her **chores**  
It‚Äôs so **ingrained**. There are so many people who go to church and just endure.
And yet, as #MeToo has rocked mainstream culture, Amish women have **instigated** their own female-driven movement. -   
But I have seen a real **uptick** over the past 10 years in Amish women coming forward.
A **patriarchal** and isolated lifestyle in which victims have little exposure to police, coaches, or anyone else who might help them  
a religion that **prioritizes** **repentance** and forgiveness over actual punishment or **rehabilitation** -  
wearing a **pleated** **head covering** and long dress, her shoes and socks a **dull black**, as her local church rules  
Except a **cousin** and her father himself, when he asked her, **point blank**, if her brothers were touching her

Because it was a **frigid** winter in Minnesota, Lizzie wore pants under her dress, which Stutzman removed while she tried **in vain** to fight him off. -  
"I was already blaming myself, thinking, Why didn't I leave the **barn** just, you know, a couple of minutes earlier?" Stutzman would rape Lizzie 25 more times over roughly five months, according to court records and Lizzie's diary. He raped her in the **hayloft**, in his house, and on the seat of his **buggy**.  
It‚Äôs common for Amish victims to be viewed by the community as just as guilty as the **abuser**‚Äîas **consenting** partners committing **adultery**, even if they‚Äôre children.  

She was **valiant**  

The fact that the **yolk** of an egg contains a high level of cholesterol was the primary cause of this

**Rigatoni** is a form of tube-shaped pasta  

but again the one who broke it should know this from CI **on the spot**

This is not the first time that Apple has found itself **at odds** with law enforcement agencies  
Data is encrypted to save it from **prying eyes** and protect users' privacy and there‚Äôs only one key to **decrypt** it which in this case is the unlock code of the iPhone -   

**Get Pumped** to Be Pumped  
**interrelated**  

**Drum roll**, please. January is here which means it's time for...The Golden Kitty Awards! üòª  

In order to give you a **glimmer** into what it looks like, ...  
**prefrontal cortex**  
You don't have to tell somebody that their **bald spot** is growing 

Furthermore, many users were clearly relying upon their **puny** human memory to remember passwords -  
**marijuana**  
I feel **sorta** bad for him, actually  
every **ward** is full, every corridor too.  
don't **inflict** your ideas on me  
the **bombardment** was **intermittent**.  
She gave me that "**come-hither**" look  

avoid getting **bogged down** on technical details that will not be relevant for long  
Some of the skills you had that will **atrophy** aren't very impactful, just necessary at the moment. -

**Parisian**  
**Hegel** 
Many **aristocrats** were killed in the French Revolution.  
The above approach could be fun, but if we‚Äôre not careful, it could become a **walled garden**. What happens outside of the commands Nu comes with?  
**fade away**  

what if all viable exploration actually **takes place** with self-**replicating** machines? A not implausible **extrapolation** of our own past couple of centuries of technological and robotic advances  
The least **extrapolation** and the greatest avoidance of our own biases and preconceptions  
But for machines (as we know them) it should only take modest **velocities** (of the order of a few tens of kilometers a second) and an ability to **withstand** thousands or tens of thousands of years of travel  
But it does raise another intriguing, **albeit** slightly more assumption-ridden idea  
**Nuts and bolts**, silicon and electrons simply don't do it. You have to be made of those fragile, **fussy**, but endlessly adaptable **carbon molecules**    
You will appear as a **fussy** person -   

They really got that communist **lingo**, including **comrades** üòú  

**humanoid** robot

We're well into the **dog days** of summer.  

I'm sorry I **stood you up**, but I had a family emergency last night.
Scarlett **bailed on** us, she said she had to take care of her sick kitty  
Sorry, man, I've gotta **bail**. **Something came up**  

In fact, the researchers found that not only did people‚Äôs memories fade, but there was also a notable decline in the **vibrancy** and **visual qualities** of their memories.

He went **ballistic** when I told him about the accident.  
**sweatshop**  
Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard **cutout**...  
Oh, I'm getting all **misty** here -  
I'm very **bendy**  
Both the **toad** and frog are **amphibian**  

it's nothing short of **appeasement**  
**malign** activity  
it's an insult to those who have been **maimed** permanently damaged -  
**trivialized**  


**tehran**  
**false economy**  
**superimpose** or replace content onto a video.

I think the system is **slanted** against us.  
Stop **manhandle** my intern. That's my job

**deplane**  
Nothing, it's just old and **dingy**, that's all.

We must **cherish** experience acquired **at the cost of** blood  

## Week 1

They sell media at a 15% **markup**  

I use GNU Screen and **Byobu** together to run multiple ‚Äútabs‚Äù in the terminal -  
Ovilia is an **up-and-coming** developer  

I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are **scandalous**. Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too! üíÉ -  

They were meant to help **prop up** farm prices and farmers.
Which is a really nice **sounding line**.  
**hit song**  
He "bounced around" a number of schools and saw a **psychiatrist** for three years, eventually attending a ranch for troubled teens where he cared for a horse to build a sense of responsibility  

The **dusting** of snow over the trees made for beautiful **scenery**  

Every other aspect of Vim is **irredeemable**. The codebase is **atrocious**   
The plugin API is **cumbersome** and **restrictive**  
The dev community is **apathetic**  
The **benevolent** dictator is **averse to** change  
Yes, +python gives you access to Python‚Äôs libraries and syntax. But your code will be **littered** with calls to vim.eval() and vim.command()  
Indentation is **haphazard** -  
Some of Vim‚Äôs source code isn‚Äôt even valid text. It‚Äôs not ASCII or UTF-8. The **venerable** file can‚Äôt figure out the encoding.
These **preprocessor** statements may seem **innocuous**, but they slow development and inhibit new features  
Complexity **stemming from** cross-platform support may be **excusable**, but even something as simple as reading keyboard input is a nightmare in Vim  
Figuring out Vim‚Äôs control flow is **harrowing**  
Anything that isn‚Äôt a bug fix is **frowned upon**  
Seriously? C89 is a quarter-century old. The number of people stuck on older compilers can **be counted on one hand**. This is a non-concern. Still, I **acquiesced**  
The rest of that thread is me being **as civil as possible**, despite discouragement at **every turn**  
The replies might as well be a **paint-by-numbers** guide on how to **alienate** new contributors  
Speaking of Bram Moolenaar: His merge criteria are **inscrutable** -  
We did our best to **cater to** Bram‚Äôs **every whim**, but it was a waste of time  
Instead, we were given hope and **strung along**, working on a patch that had no chance of getting merged  
It was **likewise** rejected  
The main dev team holds no **enmity** toward Bram Moolenaar  
I can now get a taste of the Vim community, defending a **mangled monster** of spaghetti code  
here's certainly **a laundry list** of things I would like that have not been implemented, and not even a realistic timeline for them to be implemented  
Even the way this article was tweeted out by the author was **sophomoric**  
Bram has always been professional and **courteous**  
give time for the active community to **suss out** the issues and get them fixed  
seems like it's a step in the right direction which finally someone had the **cojones** to do -

We saw product launches **of all stripes** in this space  

**subliminal** defense mechanism  
**prefrontal cortex**  
His **prefrontal cortex** is **sparring** with his **amygdala**, in other words, his upper level self is battling with his lower level self  

> Just as we all have different ranges for hearing pitch and seeing colors, we have different ranges for seeing and understanding things, we see things in our own way   
> Difference in thinking can be symbiotic and complimentary instead of disruptive  

This is illogical and leads the **suboptimal** decision-making  

And it ‚Äú**restocks** the **armory** of our immune system, helping fight malignancy, preventing infection, and warding off all manner of sickness  

ten days later, Trump signed a spending bill with about $1.4 billion **allotted** for it  
**Aristotle** defined tragedy as a terrible outcome arising from a person's fatal **flaw**  

When **scuffles** **broke out**, large numbers of **black-clad** protesters rushed to the scene while other protesters formed human chains to pass them various supplies including bricks, forcing police to bring in their own reinforcements.   

It's very difficult to **take part** unless you're part of the family, because it's a very **tight-knit** sort of family thing  
everybody get drunk, get some **eggnog**  
**astigmatism**
