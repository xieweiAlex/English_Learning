## Week 5 

Customers **swear by** the olive oil, **rotisserie** chickens, and even the golf balls made by Costco's house brand, Kirkland  
Costco's cooked rotisserie chicken is a **loss leader**  
**end table**  
**spin class**  
Costco's offerings as an **unbeatable** bargain. **Move over**, Lululemon  
**Toss** the whole **shebang** around until the quinoa is evenly distributed  

**jillion** dollars 

**Fresh off the boat**, I got no friends here  
**wake up call**  
serving the interests of their **oligarch** masters, that's what people are **sick of**  
They're not reading the **lines**  
This isn't normal, it's **outrageous**, it's **infuriating**  
**Hell or High Water** we're gonna make sure that is  
**status quo**
even more **bought out** society  
they just don't care about anybody who has a different narrative than the narrative they want to **spout**  

Apple today announced that it has closed all of its **corporate offices**, stores, and **contact centers** in mainland China through February 9 due to the Wuhan coronavirus **outbreak**, **out of** an abundance of caution.

**proponent**  
He is a Obama **holdover**  
Everything that was leaked was meant to make Trump look really **inept**  
**lieutenant** **colonel**  

The last matching pattern has the most **precedence**  
**memoire**  

But recently the discussion has taken on new **intensity**  
> but two examples of the overriding belief that the way to increase performance in companies is through rigorous, frequent, **candid**, pervasive, and often critical feedback  

how **hard-edged** and **fearlessly** **candid** should we be  
telling people what steps to follow or what **factual** knowledge they're lacking—can be truly useful  
That's why we have **checklists** in airplane **cockpits**, more recently, in **operating rooms**  
what we think of their performance doesn't help them **thrive** and **excel**, and telling people how we think they should improve actually **hinders** learning  
**Underpinning** the current **conviction** that feedback is an **unalloyed** good are three theories that we in the business world commonly accept as truths  
You do not realize that your suit is shabby, that your presentation is boring, or that your voice is **grating**, so it is up to your colleagues to tell you **as plainly as possible**  
**Hence** you can, with feedback about what excellence looks like, understand where you **fall short of** this ideal and then strive to **remedy** your shortcomings  
What these three theories have in common is **self-centeredness**  
But as it turns out, in **extrapolating** from what creates our own performance to what might create performance in others, we **overreach**  
The first problem with feedback is that humans are unreliable **raters** of other humans  
> Our evaluations are deeply **colored** by our own understanding of what we're rating others on, our own sense of what good looks like for a particular **competency**, our **harshness** or **leniency** as raters, and our own **inherent** and **unconscious** biases  
> This phenomenon is called the **idiosyncratic rater effect**, and it’s large (more than half of your rating of someone else reflects your characteristics, not hers) and resilient (no training can lessen it)  

it **stems from** a flaw in his measurement system  
Worse still, although science has long since proven that we are **color-blind**, in the business world we assume we’re **clear-eyed**  
**Deep down** we don’t think we make very many errors **at all**. We think we’re reliable raters of others. We think we’re **a source of truth**. We aren't. We’re a source of error  
The only realm in which humans are an **unimpeachable** source of truth is that of their own feelings and experiences  
When they check up on you **post-op**, they’ll ask, “On a scale of one to 10, with 10 being high, how would you rate your pain?”  
> Instead, she can be confident that you are the best judge of your pain and that all she can know for sure is that you will be feeling better when you rate your pain lower  

Thus we can tell someone whether his voice **grates** on us; whether he’s **persuasive** to us  
This is a **humbler** claim, but at least it’s accurate  
Another of our **collective theories** is that feedback contains useful information, and that this information is the **magic ingredient** that will accelerate someone's learning  
Because of your genetic inheritance and the **oddities** of your early childhood environment, your brain’s wiring is **utterly** unique  
> Joseph LeDoux, a professor of neuroscience at New York University, **memorably** described it, “Added connections are therefore more like new **buds** on a branch rather than new branches.” Through this lens, learning looks a lot like building, little by little, on the unique patterns already there within you. Which in turn means learning has to start by finding and understanding those patterns—your patterns, not someone else’s  

Focusing people on their **shortcomings** or **gaps** doesn't enable learning. It **impairs** it.  
> It’s clear that we learn most in our comfort zones, because that’s where our **neural pathways** are most **concentrated**  

the really hard part is **codifying** how we and everyone else on our team should get there  
We've got it **backward**  
Excellence is **idiosyncratic**  
it’s being **caustic**, blunt, and rude in an **incongruously** **affectless** way  
Examine something as specific and as limited as the **free throws** awarded after **fouls**, and you’ll learn that not only do the top two free-throw shooters in history have **utterly** different styles  
Excellence seems to be **inextricably** and wonderfully intertwined with whoever demonstrates it.  
> Excellence seems to be inextricably and wonderfully intertwined with whoever demonstrates it. Each person’s version of it is uniquely shaped and is an expression of that person’s individuality. Which means that, for each of us, excellence is easy, in that it is a natural, fluid, and intelligent expression of our best extremes. It can be **cultivated**, but it’s **unforced**  

then argue that good leaders should not have big egos, you will lead people **astray**  
> Because rigorous studies of the best salespeople reveal that they take rejection deeply personally, too.  

The arguments for radical **candor** and **unvarnished** and **pervasive** transparency have a **swagger** to them, almost **as if** to imply that only the finest and bravest of us can face these truths with **nerveless** **self-assurance**, that those of us who **recoil** at the thought of working in a climate of continual judgment are condemned to **mediocrity**, and that as leaders our ability to look our colleagues **squarely** in the eye and lay out their faults without blinking is a measure of our **integrity**  
But at best, this **fetish** with feedback is good only for correcting mistakes  
And at worst, it’s toxic, because what we want from our people—and from ourselves—is not, for the most part, **tidy** **adherence** to a procedure agreed upon **in advance** or, for that matter, the ability to expose one another’s flaws  

SiFive's **vertically** integrated, idea-to-silicon team is an incredible **one-stop-shop**, making it possible to develop **end-market** hardware faster and more affordably than ever before.  
"Not a good fit" is a bit of a **euphemism** in the industry  
he’s a **classy** guy and probably still under **NDA** with Tesla  
Sometimes the manager in particular is a **sociopath** or **narcissist**. Or maybe you **unknowingly** offended them in some way. At that point there’s no reason to stay, regardless of the reason

as did some of the FBI **bureaucrats** the president so **reviled**.  
**state secret**  
First, there was the **inescapable** fact that, like Osama bin Laden, 15 of the 19 **hijackers** were Saudis  
**Qaida** terrorists  
they were minimally and **grudgingly** helpful when it came to the 9/11 inquiry.

It’s so **ingrained**. There are so many people who go to church and just endure.
And yet, as #MeToo has rocked mainstream culture, Amish women have **instigated** their own female-driven movement.  
But I have seen a real **uptick** over the past 10 years in Amish women coming forward.
A **patriarchal** and isolated lifestyle in which victims have little exposure to police, coaches, or anyone else who might help them  
a religion that **prioritizes** **repentance** and forgiveness over actual punishment or **rehabilitation**

Because it was a **frigid** winter in Minnesota, Lizzie wore pants under her dress, which Stutzman removed while she tried **in vain** to fight him off.  
"I was already blaming myself, thinking, Why didn't I leave the **barn** just, you know, a couple of minutes earlier?" Stutzman would rape Lizzie 25 more times over roughly five months, according to court records and Lizzie's diary. He raped her in the **hayloft**, in his house, and on the seat of his **buggy**.  
It’s common for Amish victims to be viewed by the community as just as guilty as the **abuser**—as **consenting** partners committing **adultery**, even if they’re children.

what if all viable exploration actually **takes place** with self-**replicating** machines? A not implausible **extrapolation** of our own past couple of centuries of technological and robotic advances  
The least **extrapolation** and the greatest avoidance of our own biases and preconceptions  
But for machines (as we know them) it should only take modest **velocities** (of the order of a few tens of kilometers a second) and an ability to **withstand** thousands or tens of thousands of years of travel  
But it does raise another intriguing, **albeit** slightly more assumption-ridden idea

The **benevolent** dictator is **averse to** change  
Yes, +python gives you access to Python’s libraries and syntax. But your code will be **littered** with calls to vim.eval() and vim.command()  
Indentation is **haphazard**  
Some of Vim’s source code isn’t even valid text. It’s not ASCII or UTF-8. The **venerable** file can’t figure out the encoding.
These **preprocessor** statements may seem **innocuous**, but they slow development and inhibit new features  
Complexity **stemming from** cross-platform support may be **excusable**, but even something as simple as reading keyboard input is a nightmare in Vim  
Figuring out Vim’s control flow is **harrowing**  
Anything that isn’t a bug fix is **frowned upon**  
Seriously? C89 is a quarter-century old. The number of people stuck on older compilers can **be counted on one hand**. This is a non-concern. Still, I **acquiesced**  
The rest of that thread is me being **as civil as possible**, despite discouragement at **every turn**  
The replies might as well be a **paint-by-numbers** guide on how to **alienate** new contributors  
Speaking of Bram Moolenaar: His merge criteria are **inscrutable**  
We did our best to **cater to** Bram’s **every whim**, but it was a waste of time  
Instead, we were given hope and **strung along**, working on a patch that had no chance of getting merged  
It was **likewise** rejected  
The main dev team holds no **enmity** toward Bram Moolenaar  
I can now get a taste of the Vim community, defending a **mangled monster** of spaghetti code  
here's certainly **a laundry list** of things I would like that have not been implemented, and not even a realistic timeline for them to be implemented  
Even the way this article was tweeted out by the author was **sophomoric**  
Bram has always been professional and **courteous**  
give time for the active community to **suss out** the issues and get them fixed  
seems like it's a step in the right direction which finally someone had the **cojones** to do
