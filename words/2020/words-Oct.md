keep in mind that inversions are an **anomaly** and they don't last forever  

**give a nod to**  
An **inverted Treasury yield curve** is one of the most reliable **leading** indicators of an **impending** recession  
When this occurs, many argue that it is the laws of **supply and demand**, rather than **impending** economic doom and gloom, that enable lenders to attract buyers without having to pay higher interest rates  

It is important to remember the 2020 recession was caused by a **self-induced** shutdown and not structural or cyclical imbalances  
**Insofar** as banks are a **proxy** for the economy’s health, the **outlook** for growth is likely better than most think.

you can **grind down** your **fingernails** **scrabbling** away and making little progress  
When a wave comes, even a long slow gentle one, **buoyancy** and **turbulence** **dissolve** the surface of the sand out from under you  
until the tumbling and streaming of water triggers some instinct, and then with their **hydrofoil** shells angled into the **receding** wave, they extend their muscular tongues  
The suspended sand **slurry** offers little traction or support, so the clams **ratchet** themselves deeper, tongue by shell, as a climber on a **floppy** rope does with arms and legs  
When you find so many clams in every place you check, and then look up from your small catch to the extent of the beach, your brain cannot **fathom** the **multiplication**

It too is nestled into a graceful **arc** of **coastline**  
**Mole crabs** live a life much like clams, fishing for **debris** among the waves, but they are completely opposite in **temperament**  
From the moment they’re exposed to the air, they **frantically** dig with their **hind legs** if the surface they’re on resembles wet sand even as little as a human palm wet with seawater  
When you drop them on the sand, they right themselves like **roly-polies** and rebury themselves in a blink  
The large ones that can’t help but be caught, and will sit in your hand embarrassed to be exposed are the **matronly** females, which you can confirm from the orange eggs packed among their leg joints
Why did every **starry-eyed** post-bubble founder **plop** their headquarters in a **dinky** suburb that would fight them for office space and housing forever after? Abundance is an accident  
The political forces that would preserve the bay area’s structures **in amber**, even as its people **decamp**, cry that this growth isn’t natural  
We have such a **meager window** into such an immiserated natural world, that we don’t realize how deeply natural this is. The most **intransigent** cause of a lack of imagination is, **after all**, a lack of **referrents**  
Until now. As covid and wildfire smoke have **atomized** us all into whatever living space we can afford, and into a **grid of** separate video boxes on a screen, the place as it was no longer exists

is whoring it up in some **sleazy** motel.  
I mean, this party couldn't get any **sleazier**  
His eyes are going; he says he has **glaucoma**  
I stood **abashed** at his **rebuke** 😳
