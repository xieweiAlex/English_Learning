The stock may be heavily shorted for good reason, such as it has a **dismal** future outlook

Why Is American Airlines So **Infuriating**?  
With its industry **reeling**, the company is quietly betting that diminished competition will keep passengers coming — even as they **grumble** about poor service, late arrivals, and **jam-packed** flights.

Most recently, **shortsighted** equity investors **spouting** this mantra participated in the "tech wreck," **snapping up** shares in tech companies at inflated prices even though these firms had no hope of ever making a profit  
construct your portfolio based on long-term thinking and long-term **convictions** -  
keep in mind that inversions are an **anomaly** and they don't last forever  

**give a nod to**  
An **inverted Treasury yield curve** is one of the most reliable **leading** indicators of an **impending** recession  
When this occurs, many argue that it is the laws of **supply and demand**, rather than **impending** economic doom and gloom, that enable lenders to attract buyers without having to pay higher interest rates  

It is important to remember the 2020 recession was caused by a **self-induced** shutdown and not structural or cyclical imbalances  
**Insofar** as banks are a **proxy** for the economy’s health, the **outlook** for growth is likely better than most think.  

We have **contingency** plans  
Our success is **contingent on** your support.  

It's **rounding the corner**

you can **grind down** your **fingernails** **scrabbling** away and making little progress  
When a wave comes, even a long slow gentle one, **buoyancy** and **turbulence** **dissolve** the surface of the sand out from under you  
until the tumbling and streaming of water triggers some instinct, and then with their **hydrofoil** shells angled into the **receding** wave, they extend their muscular tongues  
The suspended sand **slurry** offers little traction or support, so the clams **ratchet** themselves deeper, tongue by shell, as a climber on a **floppy** rope does with arms and legs  
When you find so many clams in every place you check, and then look up from your small catch to the extent of the beach, your brain cannot **fathom** the **multiplication**  
> The spoils themselves seem **inconsequential**, but their implications for the scale of the vast unseen world around you **boggle** the imagination  

If they were not hidden under a few inches of sand, they would cover it like **cobbles** on a **creek bed**  
Pismo clams were a **mainstay** in the **diet** of California’s native peoples  
through management of the **fishery** alone they have so **bountifully** returned  
It too is a huge beach, with a wide, flat **intertidal** region  
It too is nestled into a graceful **arc** of **coastline**  
**Mole crabs** live a life much like clams, fishing for **debris** among the waves, but they are completely opposite in **temperament**  
From the moment they’re exposed to the air, they **frantically** dig with their **hind legs** if the surface they’re on resembles wet sand even as little as a human palm wet with seawater  
When you drop them on the sand, they right themselves like **roly-polies** and rebury themselves in a blink  
The large ones that can’t help but be caught, and will sit in your hand embarrassed to be exposed are the **matronly** females, which you can confirm from the orange eggs packed among their leg joints
Why did every **starry-eyed** post-bubble founder **plop** their headquarters in a **dinky** suburb that would fight them for office space and housing forever after? Abundance is an accident -  
The political forces that would preserve the bay area’s structures **in amber**, even as its people **decamp**, cry that this growth isn’t natural  
We have such a **meager window** into such an immiserated natural world, that we don’t realize how deeply natural this is. The most **intransigent** cause of a lack of imagination is, **after all**, a lack of **referrents** -  
Until now. As covid and wildfire smoke have **atomized** us all into whatever living space we can afford, and into a **grid of** separate video boxes on a screen, the place as it was no longer exists
