## Week 4 

it's like **pandemonium** out in the streets  

**snake oil**  
American **pollock**  

Turn the bag **inside out** or place it inside a **pillowcase** or laundry bag to avoid straps and **zippers** getting caught inside the machine  

**deregulation**  
When you're confronting both a) an economic crisis and b) a public health emergency, **the last thing you want to do** is **trip on red tap**  
You've heard stories of companies **heroically** **rejiggering** their assembly lines to **churn out** emergency medical products  
Distillers that **pivoted** to make hand sanitizer received some waivers from the government.   
But **ethanol producers** sitting on millions of gallons of lower-grade alcohol are still **petitioning** the FDA to let them help out in the effort.   
Because of the coronavirus, we might even start seeing some **midshipmen** with **mullets**  
Stop **giggling** 
Wyoming **Asphalt** Sour, a dense oil used to make paving **bitumen**, sold at negative prices in mid-March. As in, producers are paying buyers to take **barrels** off their hands.  
Some think the U.S. could enter a cold war with one of its biggest **frenemies**  

It's a sign of **detente**  
As today's report shows, the coronavirus outbreak is economically **akin to** a major hurricane occurring in every state around the country for weeks on end  


excessive drinking and **promiscuity**   
**voluptuous** women  
**sassy** girl  
**hands-down** winner  
**baby-talk**  
**monkey business**  

Many people have personal travel plans and we ask that you **heed** all government warnings and restrictions around travel. 

In recent weeks, President Trump and his administration have **promoted** public health measures that have effectively shut down large **swaths** of the U.S. economy. But now he's getting **antsy**.  
At a news conference Monday night, Trump said he didn't want the "cure" (a **self-induced** economic recession)  
he'd like to “have the country opened up and **raring** to go by Easter.”   
The stock market is **mimicking** a **bucking bronco**, and analysts say growth could tank, unemployment could **soar**, and layoffs could be devastating as much of the country's economy is **put on hold** to contain the virus  
This crisis is unique in that it **pits** economic growth against public health  
A Mount Olympus-sized pile of advertising just **went poof**  
The Olympics is a unique media event—the games draw young people and cord-cutters alike back to the **boob tube**.  
You also don’t have to be a **technophile** to **geek out** on all of its data, like **circadian** rhythm, sleep stages, and heart rate variability.  

After all, the function of **genitalia** seems simple.  
He could not get up an **atom** of sympathy for her.  
So basically the problem is you're **clingy**  
**escalator**  
You can't keep a rat in your apartment, they're **unsanitary**.  
A **buffo** character -  
A **bumblebee** **stung** me on the check  
**snowplow**  
The manager never **faltered** in his duty  

Stocks are **coming off** their worst week since 2008

she **mulled** the question over before shaking her head  
**harping** on social **blights** like racism, sexism, inequality and war.  
optimism is **justified**.  
It has been based on **crass** political calculation and willful ignorance.  
But just because Trump **et al** have indulged in irresponsible optimism during this crisis doesn't mean that all optimism is **irresponsible**. -  
Optimism in a time like this is crucial. As with climate change and war, we need to be realistic, to face the problem **squarely**, while resisting fear and **fatalism**.  
We need to retain our faith that human intelligence and decency will **prevail**.  
Trump, **in spite of** all his missteps, has sense enough to seek the advice of Anthony Fauci, an authority on infectious diseases  
Trump, for all his **missteps**, at least has the sense to rely for advice on Anthony Fauci, who since the **dawn** of the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s has been a **leading authority** on **infectious** disease.
Now let me **spell out**, in this dark time, some of my hopes:

The coronavirus crisis will bring about the end of the Trump **era**. In November, voters **appalled** by the incompetence and **mendacity** of the Trump administration will vote for Joe Biden, who will win **in a landslide**. -  

World leaders will recognize the **impracticality**, and immorality, of military spending. 

Led by the U.S., which spends more on arms than the next seven biggest spenders combined, nations will start **diverting** resources **away** from defense and toward measures for reducing climate change and poverty and improving health care and education.

If Trump gets re-elected, helped perhaps by federal payments to voters, things will still be okay. **Chastened** by the pandemic and subsequent economic depression, freed of the need to appease his right-wing base, **yearning** to go down in history as a savior, this **narcissistic**, **amoral bully** will turn out to be just the leader we need to guide humanity toward a green, just, peaceful future.

He was lurking **slyly** in the background  

**matriarch**  

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a request Monday for manufacturers to help **churn out** **ventilator** parts.

Since launching in 2016, Teams has competed **bitterly** with Slack  
**silver lining**  
Billions of people across the globe had their lives **upended** this week by the coronavirus pandemic  
Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become **lifelines** for human contact and important **headlines** in the era of #socialdistancing, putting pressure on Big Tech to **clamp down** on misinformation and potentially harmful viral **cure-alls**

The government is also **calling on** us, everyday citizens, to make extraordinary sacrifices.   
no **trivia nights**

This same opening also serves a less-sexy purpose: the **expulsion** of **urinary** and digestive waste  
When birds are feeling **frisky**, they rub their swollen **cloacas** together  
This delicate **balancing act** can often take several attempts before resulting in successful **copulation** -
