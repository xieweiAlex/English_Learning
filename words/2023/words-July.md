## Week 4  

Bitcoin is no longer **a passing fad** says Michael Sonnenshein as Bitcoin ranks 10th among world's biggest companies. Only 10% of all traded $BTC is done in the US; also the migration away from centralized exchanges continues.  
BlackRock announcing that it would launch a Bitcoin SPOT ETF set the market **ablaze** in June and that excitement spilled over into July with a ton of organizations following suit filing their applications to launch an ETF as well.

Oversight of the crypto industry has **hitherto** been a **grey area**, with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission **jockeying** for control.   

Stocks, bonds and other traditional financial instruments fall under the SEC’s **remit**, but US authorities remain **locked in** debate as to whether all — or any — crypto tokens should fall under its **purview**.

Until recently, lawmakers and regulators have mostly sat **on the sidelines**, permitting these activities to **take place**.  
Bankers are looking for a **coalescence** of guidance from **prudential** regulators as it appears this asset class is **here to stay**.  
**To date**, the banking industry has largely stood on the sidelines, **observing from afar** with little **impetus** to seriously explore how to fill market gaps and better serve their customers by providing digital asset products and services.  

And the main issue I see in California's Housing Market right now, from a homebuyer perspective, is that there is a complete lack of **distress** among sellers.

The pop culture view of startups is that they’re all about coming up with a great product idea. After the **eureka moment**, the outcome is **preordained**. This neglects the **years of toil** that entrepreneurs endure, and also the fact that the vast majority of startups change over time, often dramatically.   

> The dominant payment systems (mainly, credit card systems) were designed to be offline systems and only much later awkwardly **grafted** onto the Internet. They are inefficient and prone to fraud.  

The **modem** **inverted** the phone network, giving us the Internet.

Many people **harbor the belief** that doing it all by themselves is the most effective route.  
But Garren began to **cast a doubtful shadow** on his abilities when he started **juxtaposing** his **nascent** swimming skills with Daryl's more **polished** performance.  
The defeat in his voice was **palpable**. His six-year-old heart wore its bruises on the outside.  
Rate hikes are clearly working—with mortgage rates above 7% and credit card rates going **haywire**, the Fed must be working on something quite specific to bring down CONSUMER price inflation.  

Ask any CFO what excites them most about artificial intelligence, and you’ll get a similar answer: no more **menial** tasks and mindless data entry. But after that, try a trickier question: Which tasks are truly menial?  
As finance departments start to implement AI into their workflows, this question will be debated and litigated **ad nauseam**.  
“Anything that is currently manual entry is a **prime target**, and I would say **rightfully** so…for automation,” Glenn Hopper, CFO and director at Eventus Advisory Group, told CFO Brew. “Those tasks are **error-prone**.”

Among those, the interest rate pressure on small businesses is likely the most **suppressant** for the economy.  
However, in 2023 there are signs that the interest rate portion of the Federal Reserve’s tighter monetary policy may have gone **full circle**.  
Japan is the main example of a country that is already through the **looking glass**, where everything is flipped.  
which is likely part of the reason they've been doing the **heterodox** policy of not using interest rates in the face of inflationary pressures.

Didn't plan on staying up late to write a 2,000 word **synopsis** of a BIS paper, but here we are.  

I found these two paragraphs particularly **telling**. If you **squint hard enough** and hold your breath you can hear the BIS make a soft **admission** that the **incumbent system** is doomed to fail and they need a complete **overhaul** the maintain control.  

Their massive **overhead costs** make micropayments impossible.  
Technology also makes us more efficient at finding and **extracting oil** over time, **up to a certain point**.  
while the averages have been pulled down by certain deflationary categories such as electronics and **textiles** where massive productivity gains were made.  
The problem, of course, is that central banks can only affect a **subset** of the causes of inflation.

Depending on how **certain factors** play out, it can result in some **unintuitive** outcomes.

It’s like giving someone **Tylenol** when they have a **gunshot** wound; what really needs to be done is to stop the bleeding.  

Those people have a greater **propensity** to spend any stimulus they receive, because **their income and expenses are roughly the same** and thus their income is the strict limiter on their spending capacity.

If my sense is right, Paul Tudor Jones, Bill Miller, and Stan Druckenmiller were just the **overture**.  
This system would **ostensibly** rely on China to custody the gold and deliver trustworthy, reliable reporting.  (Not exactly their proven **forté**.)  


> Yet anyone who thinks for more than a few seconds about this can see just how vulnerable it would leave us, as well as how much corruption such "efficiency" would wind up enabling.  

The casual ease by which we made this transaction enabled by these tools had us both pause **in awe of** just how powerful they could be for the privacy and security of all communication.  
The **base plumbing** of the internet itself may very well be **on the verge of** the greatest shift it has ever gone through.  

But consider how incredibly **neutered** the experience really is when money isn't allowed to flow freely in this environment, and how much it actually would flow, if not for both centralized payment processors and the horrible KYC and regulatory hurdle it entails for large, centralized entities.  

The inevitable abuse of this immense social power for political gain is so **blatantly** obvious in retrospect that it's almost **comical**.

> It’s rarely the terrible decisions, processes, or even people that’ll sink your organization. It’s the accumulation and inertia of the mediocre ones.  
> Mediocrity happens because it’s easier to choose the path of least resistance and because there is little to pay in the moment. The actual cost manifests only in the long run.  

The **insidious** nature of mediocre decisions is why we need to push back against them as much as possible. As David puts it:  

Whether it’s a teammate pointing out you took an implementation shortcut or a friend that doesn’t let you **off the hook** on your commitment to hitting the gym, leaning on your network is guaranteed to help you in your goals.

“What constitutes a State?”. His answer is not the physical infrastucture like battlements, moats, ports or church spires; but “high-minded men” who know their duties and their rights and are willing to defend them against tyrants. That is a true state according to Jefferson.

If every user needed to perform **taint analysis** on all the funds they received, then the utility of the system would drop significantly.  
This is the fundamental principle of hash cash — force the attacker to pay **dearly** in order to create spam.  
The problem inherent to many systems operated by humans is that the rules of the system may be applied arbitrarily or may be **subject to change** at someone else’s whim. This results in systems being less reliable.

**know-it-all**.  

Their ability to perceive deep patterns and causal relationships has helped many achieve **eminence** in science, mathematics, medicine, and other INTJ careers.  
their existence is more cerebral or **dreamlike**. This can lead them to feel **estranged** from their physical **environs**, not to mention their own bodies.  
While INTJs may be relatively **unaware** of how others perceive them, their “**other-worldliness**” often earns them labels such as **quirky**, awkward, nerdy, or oblivious.  
**Onlookers** sense that INTJs seem to “live in their own world.” Immersed in their own minds and interests, INTJs can be **oblivious** to social norms or other practical aspects of life.  
INTJs are typically decent story-tellers and good for occasional injections of **droll humor** or cultural references.  
They patiently allow their Ni intuition to collect and **synthesize** all the pertinent information before they draw conclusions.  

Let the bank crisis happen, let uninsured depositors' money **go poof**. But if you gonna bail them out, you've chosen inflation.

> **Undeterred** in challenging **spurious** or poorly framed arguments, they can be formidable debaters. It truly **pains** this type to see **falsities** and **fallacies** go unchallenged.  

> **Namely**, the things that are most disturbing to INTJs, whether to their Fi sense of justice or their Ni sense of truth, are often the same things they are striving to understand and remedy. So it’s not merely rational systems (Te) that motivate INTJs, but also perceived personal and societal injustices (Fi).  

Thus, if someone wants a firm opinion about how to tackle a complex problem, they are more **apt to** get it from an INTJ.  
It truly **pains** this type to see **falsities** and **fallacies** go unchallenged.  

Don’t **despair**. Look at what’s working, look at what isn’t. Explore why it’s working, figure out how to get more consistent with it.
