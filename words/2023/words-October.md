It just **belabors**. It just **stirs up** resentments and anger. It distracts. It takes us away from what we do control, what does matter, which is how we respond. Which is how we change ourselves **in light of** the unchangeable new wrinkle in reality. -  
Don’t be trapped by **dogma**—which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.  
Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions **drown out** your own inner voice.

highly **un-nuanced** phrases.  

**aforementioned** fields  

The INTJ is naturally **attuned to** the big picture and **can’t help but** see how everything is **interconnected**.  
Their ability to perceive deep patterns and causal relationships has helped many achieve **eminence** in science, mathematics, medicine, and other INTJ careers. -  
This can lead them to feel **estranged** from their physical **environs**, not to mention their own bodies.  
**Onlookers** sense that INTJs seem to “live in their own world.”  
INTJs can be **oblivious** to **social norms** or other practical aspects of life.  
They may even joke about the nerdy or **esoteric** nature of their interests.  
Unfortunately, this can sometimes result in INTJs being **misconstrued** as arrogant “**know-it-alls**.”  
Like the INFJ, they can talk **at great length** (and depth) on topics that interest them.  
And while they are rarely the most dynamic or energetic of **orators**, INTJs are typically decent **story-tellers** and good for occasional injections of **droll humor** or cultural references.  
More **proactive types**, such as ENTJs, might even consider them a bit lazy or **apathetic**.  
Indeed, the reason that INTJs’ theories and insights are often superior is because they do not **force** things.

Because of its **prescience** and depth of insight, Ni may at times seem to **border on** magical or **supernatural**.  
This is consistent with Jung’s characterization of the Ni type as the dreamer or **seer**.  
The ultimate goal of Te is to render things logically intelligible, making them more **amenable** to human manipulation, **prediction**, and control. -  
And because Ni comes first in INTJs’ function stack, Te is ultimately more of a **servant than a master**.  
**Flesh out**.  
**state of being**.  
Te is not concerned with **procuring** **social harmony** or **group morale**. It is characteristically **impersonal**—focused on facts, objects, and systems rather than feelings.  
INTJs often feel that, regardless of how sound their arguments or the amount of evidence they present, some people simply won’t **budge**.  
When this happens repeatedly, INTJs may become **dismayed** or **nihilistic**, concerned that humanity will forever remain blind to the truth.  

They tend to be loyal and committed partners, as well as **unswervingly** devoted to the well-being of their children  
Some INTJs are emotionally **labile** and constantly turning to others for support. -  
For quite some time, I was **perplexed** as to why so many INTJs took interest in personality typology.

> The Stoics said we must always be aware of Fortune’s habit of behaving as she pleases. We must always keep in mind that we 'could leave life right now,' as Marcus Aurelius writes. That we don’t have the time to indulge in idle chit chat, to complain about small stuff, to leave things unsaid. We can’t take tomorrow for granted. We must do what we can, while we can, for whom we can.
