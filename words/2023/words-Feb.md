I'd like to have a **flock** of chickens, probably **silky** ones.  
**Truist**.

**repartee**  
**reverent**  
**patch board**

One thing we have to remember is the Stoics did not regard guilt as a productive emotion. It does nothing for you but send you **plummeting** down a **spiral** of **self-loathing**.  
That’s why it’s filled with **admonishments** for losing his temper, for being lazy, for temptations, for all sorts of bad habits or **destructive** thought patterns.  
He would have been **aghast** at the fact that Seneca regularly quoted **Epicurus** in his Letters, even if Seneca **stipulated** that he was no Epicurean.  
To **tarry** in the garden? To avoid pain? This was the **antithesis** of what the Stoic was supposed to advise or celebrate.  
And instead of **scorning** the Epicureans, we should try, as Seneca did, to learn from them.

To be able to **hop on** a flight and show up for a friend who reached out **in a time of crisis**.  
To be able to forgive a debt, to be able to pick up **a tab**, to be able to spend a few hours **furthering** a cause.  
**beat up old car**.  
I strove to welcome this **hazard**, to rejoice in whatever it brought me of the new and unexpected, and thus without shock the ambush or the **tempest** was incorporated into my plans, or my thoughts.  
Even in the **throes** of my worst disaster, I have seen a moment when sheer exhaustion reduced some part of the horror of the experience, and when I made the defeat a thing of my own in being willing to accept it.

Push yourself, have strong or **exacting** opinions for what you consume, for what you like.

**When life gives you lemons, make zest**.

**blissful ignorance**.  
**time preference**  
**value proposition**  

> You are taking the orange pill, which represents Bitcoin, freedom and monetary sovereignty or the blue pill, which means fiat money, debt and blissful ignorance.  

For those intimidated by that thought, you can’t expect people to understand bitcoin when they are **hypnotized** by fiat money, thinking it is a better viable option  
Any orange-pilled **pleb** will tell you with conviction why bitcoin is the best thing since **sliced bread**, and the only other option to this is to have fun staying poor.  
Once you realize money is an idea of what is valuable, and that idea isn’t concrete. **You ponder**.

I love working with Elad because I know when the deal is being done, he will **bend over backward** to give me extra. He will always **round off** in my favor if there’s an extra dollar being delivered here or there.  
If I **latch onto a feeling**, if I say, “Oh, I’m happy now,” and I want to stay happy, then I’m going to drop out of that happiness.  
When I was young, I had a lot of **jealousy**. **By and by**, I learned to get rid of it. It still **crops up** every now and then. It’s such a poisonous emotion because, at the end of the day, you’re **no better off** with jealousy.

All we can choose is what we do after they **befall** us. All we can influence is what they cause…  
"I can’t control that she died. I can’t do anything about that. All I can control is what her death causes, and I’m determined that it cause good things, not bad things. That’s what I’m focused on, is what does this cause? Like make sure it doesn’t cause more pain, see if it causes something else."  
What will this cause? Will it put us **out of commission** or give us a new mission? Will it cause good things or bad things?  

Accuse her of being a **fabulist**.  

While I do love Thanksgiving, it feels more and more like an **anachronism**. A brief pause in our escalators ever quickening churn higher. An old holiday we wheel out to say, look, we really are still all about community, family, and **togetherness**. Really about the **transcendent**.

**Novelty** also **wears off** fairly quickly, so if you've moved to a new city or taken a new job, you may feel an increase in happiness because you’re experiencing something new.  

Those desires will **cloud** your reality. This happens a lot of times when people are mixing politics and business.
