Some of Milland's more **remunerative** work came from employers who posted hundreds or thousands of tasks at a time that could be completed in rapid succession  
No matter where Milland was in her house, if she heard the alarm **go off**, she would run to her computer  
and then worked **furiously** to finish them and grab more before they were **snatched** by other people  
When they sent pictures of **genitals**, Milland sent back a link to a book called I’m Calling the Police  
Milland didn't feel like she could leave her apartment, or even her computer, **lest** she miss out on an opportunity to work on good tasks  
Another **slideshow** contained photos of animal abuse so **graphic** that years later Milland had trouble taking her dogs to the **vet** without crying

But there is no workers’ compensation in **the gig economy**. There is no paid sick leave in the gig economy

Flying a glider is a good metaphor here. Because a glider doesn't have an engine, you can't fly into the wind without losing a lot of altitude. If you let yourself get far downwind of good places to land, your options narrow uncomfortably. As a rule you want to stay upwind. So I propose that as a replacement for "don't give up on your dreams." **Stay upwind**

> The first thing is that everyone has **considerable** problems. Not simply occasional **tough spots**, but the type of issue that persists for years or decades.

For Jamie, and for most of us, those four major structures were not decided **consciously**. The career you end up working in depends **chiefly** on what you saw as options when you were just starting to enter the workforce.  
The result — what you do today — is more or less **happenstance**.

Did you hear about the new Microsoft Surface Laptop? The usual suspects are claiming it’s a MacBook competitor, which is true **insomuch as** it is a laptop  
This has always been the foundation of Apple’s business model: hardware differentiated by software such that said hardware can be sold with a **margin** much greater than nominal competitors running a **commodity** operating system.  
Apple Inc. reported falling iPhone sales, highlighting the need to deliver **blockbuster** new features in the next edition of the flagship device if the company is to **fend off** rivals like Samsung Electronics Co.  
**counterbalanced** by the iPad’s continued **slippage**  
Is [the iPhone] **out-of-reach** for the vast majority of consumers?  
Saying stupid things like “the iPhone 5C is equivalent to the average monthly salary in China” **belies** a fundamental misunderstanding of China, its **inequality**, and its sheer size specifically, and all of Asia broadly.  
that is why those Q2 2015 numbers are so **eye-popping** (71% growth!)  
Apple had **pulled forward** a huge number of **would-be** buyers?  

> In rather **stark contrast** to just a couple of years ago, when, in the **midst** of the iPhone 6 boom, Tim Cook was eager to sell the story of how many iPhone customers had not yet upgraded, this quarter the Apple CEO preferred to move the **goalposts**, telling analysts to wait for the next iPhone  
try and pay with cash for lunch, and you’ll look like a **luddite**.  
And to be sure, an iPhone is still **status-conferring**: Apple is **by no means** **doomed**, and it’s possible if not probable that those China numbers will turn positive this fall.  
the fundamental factor that was missed by so many for so long — is that **monopoly** on iOS  
in some countries like the U.S., too many contacts on iMessage to even **countenance** another phone ?  
None of that **lock-in** exists in China

While Taiwan is self-governed and **de-facto** independent, Beijing considers the island to be a **breakaway** province

Instead, unification was "an inevitable requirement for the great **rejuvenation** of the Chinese people".  
Taiwan remains **defiant** of Beijing's sovereignty claims  
I would like to call on China to face **squarely** the reality of the existence of the Republic of China on Taiwan  
In November, Ms Tsai's political party saw a heavy **setback** in regional elections perceived by Beijing as a **blow** to her separatist stance   
China however considers the island to be a **renegade** province - not a country in its own right - which will one day be fully reunited with the mainland
