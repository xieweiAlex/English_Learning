### The rise of Bitcoin Stocks and Companies  

> Bitcoin can’t be a store of value because it has no intrinsic value. It can’t be a unit of account because it is too volatile. It can’t be a medium of exchange because it is not widely used to price goods and services. These are the three properties of money. Therefore, Bitcoin can’t be money. But Bitcoin has no other basis for being valued, therefore it is valueless. QED.  
> In other words, there might be a finite supply of bitcoin, but the idea is infinite  

Back in 2014, Pierre Rochard wrote a **prescient** article called “Speculative Attack.”  
In economics, a speculative attack is a **precipitous** selling of untrustworthy assets by previously inactive speculators and the corresponding acquisition of some valuable assets (currencies, gold).  
> If a new monetary network with its own unit (i.e. not pegged to an existing currency as a credit rail on top of it, but rather a fully parallel system to central banks) is going to bootstrap from zero to massive, it requires upward volatility. And any appreciating asset with upward volatility will attract speculators and leverage, which inevitably leads to periods of downward volatility  

Volatility is not an inherent part of bitcoin, like would be the case if its various qualities were **erratic** and frequently changing. Its qualities are quite persistent and sound.  

> If it were to become far larger and more widely held, its volatility would diminish, both to the upside and the downside.  

> Large pools of capital buying bitcoin was always going to happen if it reached this scale.  
> A trick for generating above market risk-adjusted returns that works for 10 or even 20 years, whereupon it suddenly stops working and you lose the capital.
