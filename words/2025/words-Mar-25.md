> In general usage, if someone is belaboring a point, it usually carries a negative connotation, suggesting that the person is overdoing their explanation or criticism.  

**Stricture**  
>   ‚Ä¢ The word is more formal and is mainly used in legal, medical, or academic contexts. You might see it in news articles or official reports, but it‚Äôs not something people say in casual conversations.  
>   ‚Ä¢ Instead of ‚Äústricture,‚Äù people often use words like restriction, rule, or limitation in daily speech.  
  
**Chuffed**

>  ‚Ä¢ In the US, this word is rarely used. Americans would probably say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thrilled‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud‚Äù instead.  

**Commiserate** ‚Äì Moderately common  
>  ‚Ä¢ You‚Äôll hear this word in slightly formal or polite conversations, especially when people want to express sympathy or shared disappointment.  
>  ‚Ä¢ In casual speech, people might just say ‚ÄúI feel for you‚Äù, ‚ÄúThat sucks‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI commiserate with you.‚Äù
