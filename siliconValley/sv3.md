## E 5 

You do tend to **babble** on when you're under pressure.  
**shylock**  
Laurie Bream is out there **gallivanting** around the Valley, interviewing every **dickhole** on Earth for my job.  
Richard must not be perceived as being the most **expedient** candidate. -  
he's shown **mettle**. -  
I found my **retainer** in the school dumpster.  
Did you tell them that my Fage's **off-limits**?  

## E 4 
This baby gonna **purr**  
She has a **fiduciary** obligation as a member of the board -  
that's **factually** correct  
**motion denied**  
We will be **reconvening** tomorrow  
fuck me **sideways**  
she is **slandering** my tech  

## E 3 

She was pretty **adamant** that the whole box project here at Pied Piper was woefully misguided. -  
If I can control Laurie, do you really think I'd be looking out my office door at that **monstrosity**? -  
at this time we just have to **roll over** and do it.  
we build a **skunk works**  
If anyone **catched wind** of anything here, we're fucked.  
This is it, **no turning back** now.  
**shredder** 


## E 2  
the **flute**-playing guy  
I don't know you guys realize it, it was a little **phallic** -  
the **conjoined** triangle of success?  
I made some major **inroads** with **Hiroki**.  
It kinda all **evens out**, right?  
**get to know one another**  
in every relationship, there are **ebbs and flows**.  
don't **sneak up on** people like that, you **devious** little bastard -  
you four eyes **turd**  
I stay here for a year, I pay no rent, you have no **recourse**  


## E 1 
You madam, are a **shrew** **of the first order**.  
if I didn't vote to remove you, then Laurie would've **adjourned** the meeting, replace my seat on the board with someone else at Raviga -  
That's the **gutsiest** thing I've ever seen.  
why should we give up our shares because he's too much of a **prima donna** to let someone experienced come in -  
You're the **belle of the ball**, and these are all your **swains**, hoping for a glimpse of ankle. -   
**phonograph**  
I got to warn you though, it's pretty **rad**.  
Your **pumpedness** makes me **pumped**.  
We quit **out of solidarity** with Richard.  
1,700 people **slated** for exiting.
