## Chapter 3 

In most cases, that’s how things appeared to be going as faces **reddened** and **gazes** hardened when I finally admitted that my name wasn't Rob Caulder.  

My last **admission** had cast the practitioners in the role of teachers; and teachers don’t **hoard** information. They **disseminate** it.  

> At this point, it was evident that the recipe for disharmony was **quick and easy**. Just separate the participants into groups and let them **stew** for a while in their own juices.  

Then, **at the height of the strife**, they tried a strategy that was at once simple and effective.  
**interethnic** cooperation.  


Physical attractiveness **engenders** a **halo effect** that leads to the assignment of other traits such as talent, kindness, and intelligence.   
A potentially effective strategy for reducing the unwanted influence of liking on compliance decisions requires sensitivity to the experience of **undue** liking for a requester.
