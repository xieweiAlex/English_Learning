**Pelt, Hurl, fling, toss, lob, chuck**  

**throw, bombard, shower** 

Hurl: To throw something with great force. Unlike "pelt," which often implies multiple objects being thrown, "hurl" typically refers to a single, forceful throw.

Fling: To throw something carelessly or with a sudden motion. "Fling" suggests a lack of precision or concern.  

Chuck: Informal term for throwing something carelessly or without much effort. It's similar to "fling" but often used more casually.

Lob: To throw something in a high arc. It implies a gentle, arcing trajectory rather than a direct and forceful throw.

Bombard: To attack or throw objects at someone or something repeatedly and aggressively. "Bombard" conveys a sense of continuous and intense action.  

Shower: To throw or drop many things over a wide area. It implies a spread-out distribution, similar to "pelt" but often used for lighter items.

> As a manager, it is important to constantly upskill your team to ensure they are equipped with the latest knowledge and skills. In order to do so, you must uncover their strengths and weaknesses and unearth any hidden talents they may possess. However, you must also be careful not to fudge their performance evaluations and accurately assess their progress. As the team's motivation may wane over time, it is crucial to regularly sift through their goals and provide new challenges to keep them engaged and continuously improving.
