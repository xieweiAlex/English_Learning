As a manager, it is important to constantly upskill your team to ensure they are equipped with the latest knowledge and skills. In order to do so, you must uncover their strengths and weaknesses and unearth any hidden talents they may possess. However, you must also be careful not to fudge their performance evaluations and accurately assess their progress. As the team's motivation may wane over time, it is crucial to regularly sift through their goals and provide new challenges to keep them engaged and continuously improving.
