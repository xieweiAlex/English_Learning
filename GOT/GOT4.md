GOT IV 3 
----
Tywin **extends** an **olive branch**.  
I'm sure you've had quite a **fright**. Rest easy.  
But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who **executed** your father, **tormented** you for years, and you **fled** the scene of his murder.  
In any case, this would not be an **opportune** moment to **press** the issue.  
They're all **a tray of cakes** next to death.  
A great **doughy** **lump** I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.  
A good king must **just**.  
Everyone **applauded** his reforms. 
Was that truly **just** for him, to abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too **gullible** to recognize?

Raiders come **plundering**, steal our food, steal our silver.  
The whole country has gone **sour**  
You got any **ale**?  
She can't lift a **bale** of **hay**.  
I don't have much, but I have hidden a bit of silver from the **bandits**.  
They don't have enough men between them to raid a **pantry**.  
I've never hard of visions and **prophecies** winning a war.  
Are you **interrogating** me, Lord Tywin?  
If I cut your throat today, I'll be **drawn and quartered** tomorrow.  
So you deny the murder? --- **Categorically**
(the producers **categorically** deny that they're **dumbing down** the show)
(**Dumbing down** is the deliberate oversimplification of intellectual content within education, literature, cinema, news, video games and culture in order to relate to those unable to assimilate more sophisticated information)
And as custom dictates, three judges will **render** a **verdict**. I will **preside**.

My trial for **regicide**, yes, I know.  
If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes and gave **irrefutable** evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei.  
She's offering a **knighthood** to whomever finds Sansa Stark.  
Marrying a Targaryen was **all the rage** back then.  
(They are also all the rage)
But the moment I saw my **intended**, with his **twitchy** little **ferret**'s face and **ludicrous** silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do it.  
How **absentminded** of me.  
I was the best **archer** in my **hamlet**.  
Let the **mutineers** take care of Snow.  
(It is death for all **mutineers** in England)
If I told you to find that **murderous** little bitch, and bring me her head. Would you do it?  
You're keeping him from harm. It's **chivalry**.  
A crippled boy being pulled on a **sledge** by a **simpleton**.  
Every shelter or village will be **deserted**.  
Your **foray** to Craster's Keep, I'll **sanction** it.

He hasn't told you about the **vile** things they do with their bodies?  
They will if you **nance** around like that.  
Who told you that **shite**?  
You're a poet for your **paramour**?  
(a woman who **cohabits** with an important man)
