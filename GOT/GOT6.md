He gave them the **very** land which they **reaved** and raped and murdered.  
Shall I have a **grave** dug for her, my load? Or would you rather the men build a **pyre**?   
**mowing down** tired, **outnumbered** Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and **provisioned** Lannister army?  
A **reckoning** will come, we need the North to face it, the entire North.    
You shall always have a part in my heart, **meat and mead** at my table.
