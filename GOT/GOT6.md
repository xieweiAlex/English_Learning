## E 5 
The time has come to join the **fray**  
To **come to my aid**?  
You can't protect yourself when I ask Brienne to **cut you down**  
**guiding hand**  
Last I heard, you were **gallivanting** around the world having a grand old time  
Let the sea wash your **follies** and your **vanities** away  
is there a **cure**?  
He seems **trustworthy**, a bit **gallivanting**, perhaps  
Eat something that isn't **moss**  


## E 4 
Tyrion **strikes** a deal
**Slander** a man in his own home, you might find yourself **crossing swords** with him.  
money, **finery**, power  
**Seeking out** family means seeking out **sin**  
I'm not **maligning** you, I sought those things out, too  
My father was a **cobbler**  
**graveyard**  
We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a **stupor**  
My **ceaseless** struggle to maintain my position  
I'm advising the king on our current **predicament**. -  
We have to be very careful not to **antagonize** him  
And of course, Margaery's safety is **paramount**  
We'd **bicker** amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back  
Queen Margaery will make her walk of **atonement**.  
Yes, Margaery will **repent** her sins before the good people of the city  
When the Tyrell armies come, you will **stand down**.  
Then **stand aside** and let the people that took him from you be destroyed  
She's a **midget** -  












## E 3  
I saw your **pecker**, what kind of god would have a **pecker** that small?  
**Hold off** on burning my body for now  
I don't have John Snow or xx to help me **bend the rules**  
You're a true **liberator**, aren't you?  
One of our **leather clad** friend back in to carry it  
You **took your time**.  
Man can be **fickle** and birds I always trust  
What he's done to Gregor Clegane is an **abomination** -  
We never **sanctioned** this experiment  
When she's fully **atoned** for her sins  
when your mother made her walk of **atonement**, she did it to get back to you.  
A true leader **avails** himself of the wisest counsel he can, and no one is wiser then the gods  
Then it appears we're at a bit of an **impasse**  


## E 2 
He makes dwarf jokes, I make **eunuch** jokes.  
**at once**, my load.  
They **tied** you to the **mast** to **keep you from** jumping overboard  
I'm not a **devout** man, obviously  

## E 1 
They are dragons, they've never been **tamed**  

He gave them the **very** land which they **reaved** and raped and murdered.  
Shall I have a **grave** dug for her, my load? Or would you rather the men build a **pyre**?   
**Mowing down** tired, **outnumbered** Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and **provisioned** Lannister army?  
A **reckoning** will come, we need the North to face it, the entire North.    
You shall always have a part in my heart, **meat and mead** at my table.   
I'm thinking about locking Myrcella in a **crypt**.  
It's **prophecy**, it's fate  
She can be **overzealous** sometimes 
But sin leads us away from the **sacred**. But only confession can **purge** sin.  
I always **envied** Oberyn, he truely lived.    
Not an army, a **horde**.  
I will grant **amnesty** to all brothers  
**nightfall**  
I'd like some **muttons**
