## E 2 
He makes dwarf jokes, I make **eunuch** jokes.  
**at once**, my load.  
They **tied** you to the **mast** to **keep you from** jumping overboard  
I'm not a **devout** man, obviously  

## E 1 
They are dragons, they've never been **tamed**  

He gave them the **very** land which they **reaved** and raped and murdered.  
Shall I have a **grave** dug for her, my load? Or would you rather the men build a **pyre**?   
**Mowing down** tired, **outnumbered** Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and **provisioned** Lannister army?  
A **reckoning** will come, we need the North to face it, the entire North.    
You shall always have a part in my heart, **meat and mead** at my table.   
I'm thinking about locking Myrcella in a **crypt**.  
It's **prophecy**, it's fate  
She can be **overzealous** sometimes 
But sin leads us away from the **sacred**. But only confession can **purge** sin.  
I always **envied** Oberyn, he truely lived.    
Not an army, a **horde**.  
I will grant **amnesty** to all brothers  
**nightfall**  
I'd like some **muttons**
