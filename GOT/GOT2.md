------  
Those boys are Craster's **offerings**.  
Maybe magic once was a **mighty** force in the world.  
My brother fought **valiantly** for you.  
If Robb Stark wants a **pact** with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts.  
All the might of the Stormlands and the **Reach**.  
The north is **ripe for the taking**.  
The Ironborn will **reave** and **pillage** as it was in the old days.  
Every **stronghold** will **yield** to us one by one.  
Winterfell may **defy** us for a year, but **what of it**?  
But if we **pledge** **fealty** to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.  
You wouldn't be a cook, you pose as a **scullion**.  - A kitchen **wench**.  
I'm Shae, My lady. Your new **handmaiden**.  
**Scrub** the floor, empty my **chamber pot**, brush my hair.  
These are **perilous** times.  
And these **alliances** must often be sealed in **matrimony**.  
(In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be **compulsory** before pursuing any sexual activity)  
But the queen **mustn't** know.  
I shall be silent as the **grave**.  
Precisely. Theon's father **loathes** the Starks.  
For men in our position, holding **grudges** can be an **encumbrance**, don't you think?  
And I **suppose** you want me to **broker** this agreement.  
You would this day **consecrate** your faith to the drowned God?  
You were to be the **centerpiece** of my next **deception**  
My brother Jaime **rots** in a Northern **stockade**.  
Are you fond of **riddles**?  
One of those **dimpled chins** all the girls like.  
   
Meh, what a **noob** code, could've made Solution 2 shorter like this.  
This results in a very **jarring** and frustrating transition between modes. Let's reduce this delay to 0.1 seconds.  

## GOT E 4  
----  
They are hoses, they got **spooked** by their own shadows.  
Save you lies for the **court**, you are going to need lots of them.  
**Well played**.  
But if it's  **swordsmen** who rules, why do we pretend kinds hold all the power.  
Power **resides** where men believe it **resides**.  
Some of them may be **privy** to Tywin Lannister's plans.  
A **naked** man has few secrets, a **flayed** man none.  
Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this **cub**.  
Using some **vile** **sorcery**, your brother **fell on** Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves.  
After the slaughter, the Northerner **feasted** on the flesh of the **slain**.  
She didn't fight for her brother, your **half-wit**.  
You think **dipping** his **wick** will cure what **ails** him?  
There's no cure for being a **cunt**.  
Well, if it isn't my favorite **whoremonger**.  
I don't like the words that come **oozing** out of your mouth.  
Many believe Ned Stark **erred** by not supporting your **claim**.  
You may find yourself facing a **protracted** **siege** or open gates.  
The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers **solitude**?  
Four kings **vying** for the throne. (**vie**)  
I wasn't **tutored** in warfare, but basic **arithmetic** favors the side with the greater numbers.  
The marriage of a wealthy girl always **breeds** interest if nothing else.  
**hoof**, (**hoofbeat**)  
And you repaid our faith with **treachery**.  
Why is your **stag** on fire?  
The king has taken his **sigil**, the **fiery** heart of the Lord of light.  
Ah, you must be this fire **priestess** we hear so much about.  
And you sit beside this **pretender** and **chastise** me.  
The Iron Throne is mine **by right**.  
All those that deny that are my **foes**.  
**Turn us away** and I will burn you first.  
After we **interrogate** them, we usually just ...  
Do you have a **trade**?  --- **Smith**  
**Kneel** or I'll **carve** your **lungs** out, boy.  
Bring the girl, I need a new **cupbearer**.  
I find that **mulled** wine helps me sleep.  
Ah, **lavender** oil.  
An **anointed** knight, yes.  
I only meant I did as I was **bid**.  
Save it for Joffrey, he loves a good **grovel**.  
It was your sister's **bidding**.  
I beg her forgiveness and that **henceforth** I shall do nothing without her consent.  
I'm a knight myself **of sorts**.  

## GOT E 5  

The Starks will have **dominion** over all lands north of Moat Cailin.  
Some says it was one of his own **kingsguard**, while still others say it was Stannnis himself who did it after negotiations **went sour**.  
**Littlefinger** says we can **outspend** him three to one.  
Like **sealing** my daughter in a **crate** so you can ship her away?  
**Scheme** and **plot** are the same thing.  
It's the king's **royal prerogative** to **withhold** sensitive information from his councilors.  
If the **vile allegations** against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely?  
As long as I **consolidate** my troops.  
We **set out** for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre.  
**humility**  
Being repeatedly **humiliated** by Robb Stark is **time-consuming**.  
We are **swollen**, **bloated**, **foul**.  
   
Brother **fornicates** with sister in the bed of kings.  
(**Fornication** is generally **consensual** **sexual intercourse** between two people not married to each other. For many people, the term carries an **overtone** of moral or religious **disapproval**)  
Are we're surprised when the fruit of their **incest** is rotten?  
The king is a **lost cause**.  
A dancing king, **prancing down** his **bloodstained** halls.  
I have been **reaving** and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain.  
Don't **reckon** I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it.  
Kind of you to **see me off**.  
How am I suppose to prove myself by **pillaging** **piss-poor** fishing villages?  
The Starks have **overextended** their lines.  
They want to return home and gather the harvest before the **crops** **turn**.  
**hurrah**.  
I remember reading an old **sailor**'s **proverb**     
The **substance** burns so hot, it melts flesh like **tallow**.  
(**Tallow** is a rendered form of beef or **mutton** fat, processed from **suet**. It is solid at room temperature. Unlike suet, tallow can be stored for extended periods without the need for **refrigeration** to prevent **decomposition**, provided it is kept in an **airtight** container to prevent **oxidation**.)  
The jars are put in **catapults** and **flung** at the enemy.  
I'm afraid I have to **concur** with my **advisor**, Wisdom Hallyne  
Should you grow tired of Xaro's **baubles** and **trinkets**, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the **Undying**.  
It was **customary** for me to **extend** him an invitation.  
It is where the **warlocks** go to **squint** at dusty books.  
They actually believe their **parlor tricks** are magic.  
When they see, they shall **lust**, for dragons are fire made flesh.  
Promise me, you would not **hold me back** from killing Stannis.  
We can send two **orphan** boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your **flock**.  
They will hit us **in force**.  
We need get rid of those **lookouts**.  
You killed a **wight**  
You have the good claim, a title, a **birthright**.  

## GOT E 6  

I sent men over the walls and **grappling claw** and ropes.  
Find the **halfwit**.  
The **castle** is mine now, the people are still yours, you'll **yield** to keep them safe.  
You are all his **subject**.  
**Bugger that**, I serve the Starks.  
It **grieves** me you've less honor than a **back alley whore**.  
I was his **hostage** taken from my home.  
I urge you not to make a **hasty** decision.  
I've lost good men who fell into a **crevasse**.  (a deep **fissure**)  
You are far too smart to think that I will **succumb** to **flattery**.  
Unlike you, I do not have **exalted** ancestors, I make my living by trade.  
The **maester** came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning, he couldn't **make sense** of those letters.  
Where are you going, girl? -- The **armory**, my lord.  
Better at **amputation**, I'm afraid.  
Yes, you look positively **forlorn**.  
Your brothers **desert** you?  
We have the Lannisters **on the run**.

I **suppose** you've been **underfed** your whole life.  
Do you know what legacy means? It's what you **pass down** to your children, your grandchildren.  
The great hall has 35 **hearths**.  
If you're going to **pose** as a **commoner**, you should do it **properly**.  
   
I need **fennel root** for those with fever, **willow bark**. Mostly I need **milk of poppy**.  
The **hounds** will find the **scent** again, I'll beat them until they do. I'll **whip** all the men until I've both those boys in hand.  
And once I've got them, the **pampered** little shits... -  
Now I can never marry a **perfumed** lord.  
I'm not **well-suited** for **imprisonment**.  
Good prisoners **breed** good **jailers**, apparently.  
You ambition is an inspiration, but like all **upstarts**, you **overreach**.  
An **upstart** and a **charlatan**?  

## GOT E 9  
I spent most of my life **dodging** the royal fleet.  
I have faith in our **cause**.  
Don't **take it personally**, I don't entirely trust myself.  
Just because I pay you for your service, doesn't **diminish** our friendship.  
Oh, enhances. Fancy word for a **sellsword**.  
So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the **vanguard**?  
No plan and Stannis Baratheon **sacks** this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your **pinched** little head **atop** a gate somewhere.  
Maybe their sailors have **mutinied**.  
The lads caught a **groom** and two **maids** trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.  
**Archers** to the marks.  
**Nock** arrows.  
Hold **fast**.  
**Draw**  
**Loose**  
I'd ratter facing thousands of swords rather then with the flock of **frightened** **hens**.  
If my **wretched** brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their **cocks**.  
**Heave**  (Pull up the big stone )  
This is your city which Stannis is **ramming**.  
Shall we sing a **hymm**?  
Season two **Finale**.  


## E 10 && E 11  
------  
These are your new **chambers**.  
A little **cramped**, perhaps, but you don't need much room do you?  
I'd like to hear the **wishes** of my people.  
I don't **abuse** them to satisfy royal **whims**.  
To create **strife** between my sister and me.  
Would it be **excessive** for me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?  
To be a dancing master is a special thing,  but to be a **faceless** man, that's something else entirely.  
Dragon **screechings** continue  
They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as **gruesome** as all that.  
Because you've **slandered** me to Father before.  
Under my **patronage** you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch.  
You spent your days as always has, bedding **harlots** and drinking with thieves.  
I led the **foray** when thee enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, **quivered** in fear behind the walls.  
As my reward, I was **trundled** off to some dark little cell.  
And I would let myself be consumed by **maggots** before **mocking** the family name and making you **heir** to Casterly Rock.  
You are an **ill-made** **spiteful** little creature, full of envy, **lust**, and low **cunning**
