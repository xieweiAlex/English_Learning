The boy can't survive on **walnuts**.  
We can't **outrun** hounds forever.  
A **wolfsbane**, a rare substance. This is no common **assassin**.  
**Pretentious** name for a band of **outlaws**.  
We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with **impunity**.  
I **suppose** you've been **underfed** your whole life.  
Do you know what legacy means? It's what you **pass down** to your children, your grandchildren.  
The great hall has 35 **hearths**.  
If you're going to **pose** as a **commoner**, you should do it **properly**.  
   
I need **fennel root** for those with fever, **willow bark**. Mostly I need **milk of poppy**.  
The **hounds** will find the **scent** again, I'll beat them until they do. I'll **whip** all the men until I've both those boys in hand.  
And once I've got them, the **pampered** little shits... -  
Now I can never marry a **perfumed** lord.  
I'm not **well-suited** for **imprisonment**.  
Good prisoners **breed** good **jailers**, apparently.  
You ambition is an inspiration, but like all **upstarts**, you **overreach**.  
An **upstart** and a **charlatan**?  

E9  
-------  
I spent most of my life **dodging** the royal fleet.  
I have faith in our **cause**.  
Don't **take it personally**, I don't entirely trust myself.  
Just because I pay you for your service, doesn't **diminish** our friendship.  
Oh, enhances. Fancy word for a **sellsword**.  
So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the **vanguard**?  
No plan and Stannis Baratheon **sacks** this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your **pinched** little head **atop** a gate somewhere.  
Maybe their sailors have **mutinied**.  
The lads caught a **groom** and two **maids** trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.  
**Archers** to the marks.  
**Nock** arrows.  
Hold **fast**.  
**Draw**  
**Loose**  
I'd ratter facing thousands of swords rather then with the flock of **frightened** **hens**.  
If my **wretched** brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their **cocks**.  
**Heave**  (Pull up the big stone )  
This is your city which Stannis is **ramming**.  
Shall we sing a **hymm**?  
Season two **Finale**.  


E10 && E11  
------  
These are your new **chambers**.  
A little **cramped**, perhaps, but you don't need much room do you?  
I'd like to hear the **wishes** of my people.  
I don't **abuse** them to satisfy royal **whims**.  
To create **strife** between my sister and me.  
Would it be **excessive** for me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?  
To be a dancing master is a special thing,  but to be a **faceless** man, that's something else entirely.  
Dragon **screechings** continue  
They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as **gruesome** as all that.  
Because you've **slandered** me to Father before.  
Under my **patronage** you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch.  
You spent your days as always has, bedding **harlots** and drinking with thieves.  
I led the **foray** when thee enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, **quivered** in fear behind the walls.  
As my reward, I was **trundled** off to some dark little cell.  
And I would let myself be consumed by **maggots** before **mocking** the family name and making you **heir** to Casterly Rock.  
You are an **ill-made** **spiteful** little creature, full of envy, **lust**, and low **cunning**
