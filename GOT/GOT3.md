(bed **canopy**)
Your mother would want you to **carry on**.  
Such an **ingrate** I spent days with the **goldsmith** getting the details just right.  
You think I'd let that old **lecher** put his hands on me?  
Let's see, you started a **brawl** in the streets with Ned Stark and **disappeared** from the capital.

Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him **all the same**.

Google systematically **steamrolled** over all existing search options until it was almost impossible to imagine conducting a search without it.

As **restitution** for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its **attendant** lands.
