### E 1
You will never **web** the prince, you will web the king.  
You're a **man of action**, aren't you?  
They're **poachers** and thieves, not solder -   
He swings a sword like a girl with **palsy**. -   
They watch all of us, ready to **dole out** mercy or justice  
Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous **proposition**. -  
A **drunken** dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.  
You've many high qualities, **self-pity** is not one of them.  
I'm not **well-suited** for work.  
When did the Unsullied start **patrolling** the streets of Meereen?  
Our mission to Yunkai was a **resounding** success.  
They did ask for some **concession**. -  
No **fighting pits**.  
I do not respect the tradition of human **cockfighting**.  


## E 2 
Stannis **tempts** Jon. An adviser **tempts** Dany
here you will find the man you **seek**  
**ale**?  
I thought you still **mourned** the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.  
She's **dyed** her hair, but it's her.  
I don't know the **fuss about**.  
I'll **shield** your back and keep your **counsel**.  
Oberyn was **slain** during a trial by combat 
We do not **mutilate** little girls for **vengeance**.  
You understand fear **once long ago**, but you've forgotten what it means.  
Give him a trial at least, a fair trial, show all the citizens of Meereen that you're better than those who would **depose** you.  
And his efforts to **stamp out** **dissent**.  
They find us **repulsive**.  
**over there**  
On this **occasion**, he's asked me to speak on his behalf.  
I did not come back to the Capital to watch you stack the small council with **sycophants**. -
