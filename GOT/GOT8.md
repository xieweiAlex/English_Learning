## E 6 
**oblivion** is the best I can hope for  
This will never **torment** us  
Danny is the one who's more **torn** here  
Cersei **divulges** there never was a baby -  
It was all part of playing the game to **simultaneously** keep him and Euron **in check**  
**heightens the stakes** of the night King and provide more fulfilment **arcs** for many of her beloved characters  


## E 5 
If you hear them ringing the bells, **call off** the attack.  

## E 4 
For those who **come after** us  
Say something **snide** -  
He's **temperate** and **measured**. He's a man  
You could **temper** her worst **impulse**?  
Our last chance to avoid a **carnage**  
We understand **nothing of the sort**  
Your armies are **battle-weary** and **depleted**  
If John keeps the secret **buttoned down** and tells no one  
she is willing to **roll the dice**  

## E 2 
> She is always good at using the truth to tell lies  

Maybe after I'm dead, I will march to the King's Landing and **rip** her **apart**  
I asked him to be my hand because he was good, and intelligent, and **ruthless** when he had to be.  
I will defend the **crypt** then  
the **perils** of **self-betterment**

**Suckled** me at her **teat** for three months, thought I was her baby   
I'm sorry we **parted** the way we did  
Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a **sermon**  
Dany comes to Sansa with a little bit of **olive branch**  

## E 1 
How did you **sneak up on** me?  
You're **insolent**  
I'm **partial to** older gentleman  
Poor girl, the **pox** will take her within the year  
Jon's not always the quickest on the **uptake**, but eventually gets there  
The truth Samwell tells John is probably the most **incendiary** fact in the entire world of the show
